## The Core Insight

> "The most automated businesses don't sell creativity — they sell structure."

This pipeline generates:
- **Text pages** → SEO traffic → Ad revenue
- **Infographics** → Stock sites → Licensing
- **Printable PDFs** → Marketplaces → Direct sales
- **Structured JSON** → APIs → B2B licensing

All from the same knowledge base. One topic → multiple outputs.

python pipeline.py --designs 10 --skip-upload

# Generate educational content only
python pipeline.py --designs 10 --educational-only

# Full pipeline with uploads
python pipeline.py --designs 10
```

## The Key Principle

> **One logic engine → Thousands of outputs → Silent distribution**

Not: "What should I create next?"
But: "What rule system generates infinite useful assets?"

---

## What NOT To Do

❌ Social media posting
❌ Newsletters
❌ Community building
❌ Trend chasing
❌ Personal branding
❌ Custom client work

These kill automation.
