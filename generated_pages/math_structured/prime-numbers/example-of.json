  "content": "1. INTRODUCTION:\nA prime number is a whole number greater than 1 that has exactly two distinct factors: 1 and itself. In other words, the only numbers that can divide a prime number evenly are 1 and the prime number itself. For instance, the number 7 is prime because the only numbers that can divide it without leaving a remainder are 1 and 7. Understanding prime numbers is crucial in mathematics and other fields, as they serve as the building blocks for all other numbers.\n\n2. EVERYDAY EXAMPLES:\nPrime numbers appear in various aspects of daily life, often going unnoticed. For example, a basketball team with 11 players can be divided into smaller teams, but 11 itself can only be divided evenly by 1 and 11, making it a prime number. Similarly, a recipe for 13 cookies can only be evenly divided among 1 or 13 people, as 13 is a prime number. In the context of time, the 7-day week is a common example, where the only factors of 7 are 1 and 7. Lastly, a group of 23 students can be divided into smaller groups, but 23 itself is a prime number because it can only be divided evenly by 1 and 23.\n\n3. NOTABLE EXAMPLES:\nSome well-known examples of prime numbers include 2, 3, and 5. The number 2 is the only even prime number, as every other even number can be divided by 2. The number 3 is a prime number, as it can only be divided evenly by 1 and 3. The number 5 is also prime, and it is often used as an example in mathematics due to its simplicity. These numbers have been extensively studied and appear frequently in mathematical formulas and theorems.\n\n4. EDGE CASES:\nOne unusual example of a prime number is 997. This number is prime because it can only be divided evenly by 1 and 997. Although it is a large number, it still meets the criteria for being prime. Another example is the number 37, which is a prime number that appears in various mathematical contexts, such as number theory and algebra.\n\n5. NON-EXAMPLES:\nSome numbers that people often confuse for prime numbers are 4, 6, and 9. The number 4 is not prime because it can be divided evenly by 2, in addition to 1 and 4. The number 6 is also not prime, as it can be divided by 2 and 3, in addition to 1 and 6. The number 9 is not prime because it can be divided by 3, in addition to 1 and 9. These numbers have more than two factors, which disqualifies them from being prime.\n\n6. PATTERN:\nAll valid examples of prime numbers have one thing in common: they can only be divided evenly by 1 and themselves. This characteristic is the defining feature of prime numbers and sets them apart from other types of numbers. Whether it is a small number like 2 or a large number like 997, the only factors of a prime number are 1 and the number itself. This pattern is consistent across all prime numbers, regardless of their size or context, and it is the foundation for understanding and identifying prime numbers in various mathematical and real-world applications.",
