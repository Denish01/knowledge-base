# What is How Does Least Common Multiple Work?

1. QUICK ANSWER: The least common multiple (LCM) is a mathematical operation that finds the smallest number that is a multiple of two or more numbers. This is achieved by identifying the common multiples of the given numbers and selecting the smallest one.

2. STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS: To find the LCM, first, list the multiples of each number. Then, identify the common multiples among the lists. Next, compare the common multiples to determine the smallest one. After that, verify that the selected number is indeed a multiple of all the given numbers. Finally, confirm that the LCM is the smallest number that satisfies this condition.

For example, to find the LCM of 4 and 6, first, list the multiples of 4: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, etc. Then, list the multiples of 6: 6, 12, 18, 24, etc. Next, identify the common multiple, which is 12. After that, verify that 12 is indeed a multiple of both 4 and 6. Finally, confirm that 12 is the smallest number that is a multiple of both 4 and 6.

3. KEY COMPONENTS: The key components involved in finding the LCM are the given numbers, their multiples, and the common multiples. The given numbers are the numbers for which the LCM is being found. The multiples are the numbers that can be divided by the given numbers without leaving a remainder. The common multiples are the numbers that are multiples of all the given numbers.

4. VISUAL ANALOGY: A simple analogy to understand the LCM is to think of it as finding the smallest number of blocks that can be evenly divided into different sized groups. For example, if you have groups of 4 and 6, the smallest number of blocks that can be evenly divided into groups of 4 and 6 is 12, because 12 can be divided into 3 groups of 4 or 2 groups of 6.

5. COMMON QUESTIONS: But what about numbers that have no common multiples? In such cases, the LCM is the product of the two numbers. But what about finding the LCM of more than two numbers? To find the LCM of more than two numbers, first find the LCM of two numbers, then find the LCM of the result and the next number, and so on. But what about the relationship between the LCM and the greatest common divisor (GCD)? The product of the LCM and GCD of two numbers is equal to the product of the two numbers.

6. SUMMARY: The least common multiple is the smallest number that is a multiple of two or more numbers, found by listing the multiples of each number, identifying the common multiples, and selecting the smallest one that is a multiple of all the given numbers.
