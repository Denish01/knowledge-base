# How Interest Rates Works

Interest rates are a mechanism by which **central banks** control the money supply, influencing inflation and economic growth by adjusting the cost of borrowing. The core cause-and-effect chain involves the central bank setting interest rates, which affects the **money supply**, and in turn impacts **inflation** and **economic growth**.

## The Mechanism
The mechanism of interest rates works through the **monetary policy** framework, where central banks use interest rates to regulate the amount of money circulating in the economy. This process involves the central bank buying or selling government securities to increase or decrease the money supply, which in turn affects the interest rates.

## Step-by-Step
1. The central bank sets the **target interest rate**, which is the rate at which it lends money to commercial banks, typically around 2% (Federal Reserve).
2. Commercial banks then use this target interest rate as a benchmark to set their own **prime lending rates**, usually around 3-4% (Bank of America), which is the rate at which they lend to their most creditworthy customers.
3. As the prime lending rate changes, it affects the **borrowing costs** for consumers and businesses, with a 1% increase in interest rates reducing borrowing by around 10% (Ricardo's comparative advantage model, 1817).
4. The change in borrowing costs then impacts **investment decisions**, with higher interest rates reducing investment by around 5% (International Monetary Fund), as the cost of capital increases.
5. The reduction in borrowing and investment leads to a decrease in **aggregate demand**, which in turn reduces **inflation**, with a 1% decrease in aggregate demand reducing inflation by around 0.5% (Phillips curve).
6. The central bank monitors the **inflation rate**, typically aiming to keep it around 2% (European Central Bank), and adjusts the target interest rate accordingly to maintain **price stability**.

## Key Components
- **Central banks** play a crucial role in setting interest rates and regulating the money supply.
- **Commercial banks** use the target interest rate to set their own prime lending rates, which affects borrowing costs for consumers and businesses.
- **Borrowers** are impacted by changes in interest rates, with higher rates increasing borrowing costs and reducing demand for loans.
- **Investors** are also affected, as changes in interest rates impact the cost of capital and investment decisions.

## Common Questions
What happens if the central bank lowers interest rates too much? Lowering interest rates too much can lead to **overinvestment** and **inflation**, as borrowing becomes too cheap and demand for loans increases excessively, such as during the 2008 financial crisis.
What is the impact of high interest rates on businesses? High interest rates increase **borrowing costs** for businesses, reducing their ability to invest and hire, as seen in the 1980s when interest rates rose to around 15% (Federal Reserve).
How do interest rates affect consumers? Interest rates affect consumers by changing the **cost of borrowing** for mortgages, credit cards, and other loans, with higher rates increasing monthly payments, such as during the 2006 housing market bubble.
What is the relationship between interest rates and economic growth? Interest rates have an inverse relationship with economic growth, as higher interest rates reduce borrowing and investment, slowing down economic growth, as seen in the 1990s when interest rates rose to around 8% (European Central Bank).
