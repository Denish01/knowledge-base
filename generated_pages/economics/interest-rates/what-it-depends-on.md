# What Interest Rates Depends On

Interest rates depend on **Inflation Expectations**, as unmanaged inflation can lead to decreased purchasing power and reduced savings value, exemplified by the high inflation rates in Zimbabwe in the 2000s, which rendered their currency nearly worthless.

## Key Dependencies
- **Inflation Expectations** — accurate forecasting of inflation rates is necessary to set interest rates, as misjudging inflation can lead to economic instability, such as the situation in Argentina in 2019, where high inflation expectations led to a sharp depreciation of the peso.
- **Economic Growth** — interest rates are influenced by the state of the economy, with low growth requiring lower interest rates to stimulate borrowing and spending, as seen in the European Central Bank's decision to lower interest rates in 2014 to combat low economic growth.
- **Unemployment Rates** — low unemployment can lead to higher interest rates to control inflation, while high unemployment may require lower interest rates to boost job creation, as demonstrated by the US Federal Reserve's decision to lower interest rates in 2008 during the financial crisis.
- **Global Events** — geopolitical events, such as wars or sanctions, can impact interest rates by affecting investor confidence and economic stability, as seen in the increase in interest rates following the 1979 Iranian Revolution.
- **Monetary Policy** — central banks use interest rates as a tool to control inflation and stabilize the economy, with expansionary monetary policy typically involving lower interest rates, as implemented by the Bank of Japan in 2013 to stimulate economic growth.
- **Fiscal Policy** — government spending and taxation policies can influence interest rates, with high budget deficits potentially leading to higher interest rates to finance government debt, as experienced by Greece during the European sovereign debt crisis.

## Priority Order
Ranking the dependencies from most to least critical:
1. **Inflation Expectations** — as unmanaged inflation can have severe and long-lasting effects on the economy, making accurate forecasting crucial.
2. **Economic Growth** — as low growth can lead to reduced spending, investment, and job creation, requiring prompt action to stimulate the economy.
3. **Unemployment Rates** — as high unemployment can lead to social and economic instability, making it essential to implement policies to boost job creation.
4. **Monetary Policy** — as central banks' decisions on interest rates can have a significant impact on the economy, requiring careful consideration of the potential effects.
5. **Global Events** — as geopolitical events can have unpredictable and far-reaching consequences, making it essential to monitor and respond to these events.
6. **Fiscal Policy** — as government spending and taxation policies can have a significant impact on the economy, but are often slower to implement and less directly tied to interest rates than other factors.

## Common Gaps
People often overlook the impact of **Global Events** on interest rates, assuming that domestic economic factors are the primary drivers of interest rate changes, which can lead to a failure to anticipate and respond to external shocks, such as the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, which had a significant impact on global interest rates.
