# Interest Rates Compared

## Definition
Interest Rates Compared refers to the analysis of interest rates across different countries, institutions, or time periods, a concept rooted in **Ricardo's comparative advantage model, 1817**.

## How It Works
The comparison of interest rates involves examining the **yield curves** of different economies, which illustrate the relationship between interest rates and loan durations. For instance, the United States' yield curve, as reported by the **Federal Reserve**, typically slopes upward, indicating higher interest rates for longer-term loans. In contrast, the **European Central Bank**'s yield curve has been known to be flatter, reflecting the region's differing economic conditions. The **Fisher equation**, developed by Irving Fisher, provides a framework for understanding the relationship between interest rates, inflation, and expected returns, with the equation stating that the nominal interest rate equals the real interest rate plus the expected inflation rate.

As interest rates fluctuate, they impact the **money supply** and, subsequently, the overall economy. The **monetary policy** implemented by central banks, such as the **Federal Reserve** in the United States, aims to regulate interest rates to promote economic growth, control inflation, and maintain financial stability. The **Taylor rule**, developed by John Taylor, provides a guideline for setting interest rates based on inflation and output gaps. For example, when the **Federal Reserve** lowers interest rates, it increases the money supply, stimulating economic growth by making borrowing cheaper, as seen in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis when the Fed lowered the federal funds rate to near zero.

The comparison of interest rates also involves considering the **credit risk** associated with lending to different countries or institutions. The **credit default swap** (CDS) market provides a measure of credit risk, with higher CDS spreads indicating a higher perceived risk of default. For instance, the CDS spread for **Greece** has been significantly higher than that of **Germany**, reflecting the differing creditworthiness of the two countries. The **International Monetary Fund** (IMF) monitors credit risk and provides guidance on managing debt and promoting financial stability.

## Key Components
- **Nominal interest rate**: the interest rate that does not account for inflation, which affects the purchasing power of the loan; an increase in the nominal interest rate reduces borrowing and spending.
- **Real interest rate**: the interest rate adjusted for inflation, which reflects the actual return on investment; a higher real interest rate attracts foreign investment, as seen in the case of **Switzerland**, which has historically offered high real interest rates.
- **Yield curve**: a graphical representation of the relationship between interest rates and loan durations; a steep yield curve indicates high expectations for future economic growth, while a flat yield curve suggests low expectations.
- **Credit risk**: the risk of default associated with lending to a particular country or institution; a higher credit risk leads to higher interest rates, as lenders demand a higher return to compensate for the increased risk.
- **Liquidity**: the ability to quickly buy or sell assets without significantly affecting their price; high liquidity reduces the risk of holding an asset, leading to lower interest rates, as seen in the case of **US Treasury bonds**, which are highly liquid.

## Common Misconceptions
**Myth:** Higher interest rates always lead to higher economic growth — **Fact:** High interest rates can actually reduce economic growth by increasing borrowing costs and reducing consumption, as seen in the case of **Brazil**, where high interest rates have hindered economic growth.
**Myth:** The **Federal Reserve** has complete control over interest rates — **Fact:** The Fed influences interest rates through monetary policy, but market forces, such as **inflation expectations** and **global economic trends**, also play a significant role in determining interest rates.
**Myth:** Interest rates are uniform across all countries — **Fact:** Interest rates vary significantly across countries, reflecting differences in economic conditions, credit risk, and monetary policy, as seen in the differing interest rates between **Japan** and **Australia**.

## In Practice
In 2019, the **European Central Bank** implemented a negative interest rate policy, charging banks 0.5% to hold excess reserves, in an effort to stimulate economic growth and combat low inflation. This move led to a decrease in borrowing costs for households and businesses, with the **eurozone**'s average interest rate on new loans to households falling to 1.3% (European Central Bank). In contrast, the **Federal Reserve** in the United States raised interest rates in 2018 to 2.5%, citing a strong labor market and rising inflation (Federal Reserve). The differing interest rate policies reflect the unique economic conditions and challenges faced by each region, with the ECB aiming to boost growth and the Fed seeking to prevent overheating.
