  "content": "There are six main categories of interest rates, organized by their application and characteristics: **Nominal Interest Rate**, **Real Interest Rate**, **Effective Interest Rate**, **Flat Interest Rate**, **Fixed Interest Rate**, and **Floating Interest Rate**.\n\n## Main Categories\n- **Nominal Interest Rate** \u2014 the rate charged on a loan or credit product without considering inflation, as seen in the 4% nominal interest rate on a **Wells Fargo** credit card.\n- **Real Interest Rate** \u2014 the rate of return on an investment or loan after adjusting for inflation, such as the 2% real interest rate on a **US Treasury bond**.\n- **Effective Interest Rate** \u2014 the rate that reflects the effects of compounding interest, as in the 6% effective interest rate on a **Bank of America** savings account.\n- **Flat Interest Rate** \u2014 a fixed interest rate charged on a loan, regardless of the loan's outstanding balance, as with the 5% flat interest rate on a **Ford Motor Credit** auto loan.\n- **Fixed Interest Rate** \u2014 an interest rate that remains constant over the life of a loan, exemplified by the 3.5% fixed interest rate on a **Fannie Mae** mortgage.\n- **Floating Interest Rate** \u2014 an interest rate that fluctuates based on market conditions, as with the **Libor**-based floating interest rate on a **JPMorgan Chase** commercial loan.\n\n## Comparison Table\n| Category | Cost | Scale | Speed |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Nominal Interest Rate** | Lower | Large | Fast |\n| **Real Interest Rate** | Higher | Small | Slow |\n| **Effective Interest Rate** | Medium | Medium | Medium |\n| **Flat Interest Rate** | Higher | Small | Fast |\n| **Fixed Interest Rate** | Lower | Large | Slow |\n| **Floating Interest Rate** | Medium | Medium | Fast |\n\n## How They Relate\nThe **Nominal Interest Rate** and **Real Interest Rate** are related in that the real interest rate is calculated by subtracting the inflation rate from the nominal interest rate, as described in **Fisher's equation of exchange**. The **Fixed Interest Rate** and **Floating Interest Rate** are often compared when considering loan options, with fixed rates providing stability and floating rates offering flexibility. Meanwhile, the **Effective Interest Rate** and **Flat Interest Rate** can be confused due to their similar names, but they serve distinct purposes in calculating interest accrual. Specifically, the **Effective Interest Rate** is used to calculate the interest earned on a savings account, while the **Flat Interest Rate** is used to calculate the interest charged on a loan. The **Nominal Interest Rate** and **Effective Interest Rate** can also be related, as the effective interest rate takes into account the compounding of interest on a nominal interest rate.",
