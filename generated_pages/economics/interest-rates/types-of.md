# Types of Interest Rates

There are six main categories of interest rates, organized by their application and characteristics: **Nominal Interest Rate**, **Real Interest Rate**, **Effective Interest Rate**, **Flat Interest Rate**, **Fixed Interest Rate**, and **Floating Interest Rate**.

## Main Categories
- **Nominal Interest Rate** — the rate charged on a loan or credit product without considering inflation, as seen in the 4% nominal interest rate on a **Wells Fargo** credit card.
- **Real Interest Rate** — the rate of return on an investment or loan after adjusting for inflation, such as the 2% real interest rate on a **US Treasury bond**.
- **Effective Interest Rate** — the rate that reflects the effects of compounding interest, as in the 6% effective interest rate on a **Bank of America** savings account.
- **Flat Interest Rate** — a fixed interest rate charged on a loan, regardless of the loan's outstanding balance, as with the 5% flat interest rate on a **Ford Motor Credit** auto loan.
- **Fixed Interest Rate** — an interest rate that remains constant over the life of a loan, exemplified by the 3.5% fixed interest rate on a **Fannie Mae** mortgage.
- **Floating Interest Rate** — an interest rate that fluctuates based on market conditions, as with the **Libor**-based floating interest rate on a **JPMorgan Chase** commercial loan.

## Comparison Table
| Category | Cost | Scale | Speed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Nominal Interest Rate** | Lower | Large | Fast |
| **Real Interest Rate** | Higher | Small | Slow |
| **Effective Interest Rate** | Medium | Medium | Medium |
| **Flat Interest Rate** | Higher | Small | Fast |
| **Fixed Interest Rate** | Lower | Large | Slow |
| **Floating Interest Rate** | Medium | Medium | Fast |

## How They Relate
The **Nominal Interest Rate** and **Real Interest Rate** are related in that the real interest rate is calculated by subtracting the inflation rate from the nominal interest rate, as described in **Fisher's equation of exchange**. The **Fixed Interest Rate** and **Floating Interest Rate** are often compared when considering loan options, with fixed rates providing stability and floating rates offering flexibility. Meanwhile, the **Effective Interest Rate** and **Flat Interest Rate** can be confused due to their similar names, but they serve distinct purposes in calculating interest accrual. Specifically, the **Effective Interest Rate** is used to calculate the interest earned on a savings account, while the **Flat Interest Rate** is used to calculate the interest charged on a loan. The **Nominal Interest Rate** and **Effective Interest Rate** can also be related, as the effective interest rate takes into account the compounding of interest on a nominal interest rate.
