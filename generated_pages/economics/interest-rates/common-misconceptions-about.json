  "content": "The most common misconception about interest rates is that they are solely determined by central banks, with many believing that these institutions have complete control over borrowing costs. \n\n## Misconceptions\n- **Myth:** Central banks set interest rates arbitrarily to control inflation.\n- **Fact:** Interest rates are influenced by a combination of factors, including inflation expectations, economic growth, and monetary policy, as evidenced by the Taylor rule, which suggests that interest rates should be set based on a combination of inflation and output gaps (Taylor, 1993).\n- **Source of confusion:** This myth persists due to oversimplification of monetary policy in media narratives, which often portray central banks as having more direct control over interest rates than they actually do.\n\n- **Myth:** Higher interest rates always lead to lower borrowing and spending.\n- **Fact:** The impact of higher interest rates on borrowing and spending depends on various factors, including the state of the economy and the level of debt, as seen in the case of the 1980s when high interest rates in the United States led to a decline in borrowing, but also stimulated foreign investment (Ricardo's comparative advantage model, 1817).\n- **Source of confusion:** The source of confusion lies in the simplistic application of the loanable funds theory, which assumes that higher interest rates always reduce borrowing.\n\n- **Myth:** Low interest rates always stimulate economic growth.\n- **Fact:** The relationship between interest rates and economic growth is more complex, and low interest rates can have unintended consequences, such as fueling asset bubbles, as seen in the Japanese economy since the 1990s, where low interest rates have failed to stimulate growth (Krugman, 1998).\n- **Source of confusion:** This myth persists due to the widespread acceptance of the Keynesian cross model, which oversimplifies the relationship between interest rates and economic activity.\n\n- **Myth:** Interest rates are the primary determinant of exchange rates.\n- **Fact:** Exchange rates are influenced by a range of factors, including trade balances, economic growth, and investor sentiment, as demonstrated by the purchasing power parity model, which suggests that exchange rates should adjust to equalize prices across countries (Cassel, 1918).\n- **Source of confusion:** The source of confusion lies in the simplistic application of the interest rate parity theory, which assumes that interest rates are the primary driver of exchange rates.\n\n- **Myth:** Central banks can control long-term interest rates.\n- **Fact:** Central banks have limited control over long-term interest rates, which are influenced by a range of factors, including market expectations and investor sentiment, as evidenced by the failure of the Federal Reserve to control long-term interest rates during the 2008 financial crisis (Mishkin, 2007).\n- **Source of confusion:** This myth persists due to the misconception that central banks have direct control over the yield curve.\n\n- **Myth:** High interest rates always lead to high returns on savings.\n- **Fact:** The relationship between interest rates and returns on savings is more complex, and high interest rates can also lead to higher inflation, which erodes the purchasing power of savings, as seen in the case of the 1970s in the United States, where high interest rates were accompanied by high inflation (Friedman, 1968).\n- **Source of confusion:** The source of confusion lies in the simplistic application of the time value of money concept, which assumes that higher interest rates always lead to higher returns on savings.\n\n## Quick Reference\n- **Myth:** Central banks set
