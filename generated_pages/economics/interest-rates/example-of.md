# Example of Interest Rates

## Definition
Example of Interest Rates refers to the percentage at which borrowed money is paid back, with the **lender** earning interest and the **borrower** paying it, as described in **Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk's** theory of interest, which posits that interest rates are determined by the interaction of supply and demand in the loan market.

## How It Works
Interest rates are determined by the interaction of **supply and demand** in the loan market, with lenders supplying loanable funds and borrowers demanding them. The **Federal Reserve**, the central bank of the United States, plays a crucial role in setting interest rates through its **monetary policy** decisions, such as setting the **federal funds rate**, which influences the **prime lending rate** and subsequently affects the interest rates charged to borrowers. For instance, when the Federal Reserve lowers the federal funds rate, banks can borrow money at a lower rate, which in turn allows them to lend to customers at a lower rate, stimulating borrowing and spending.

The **yield curve**, which plots the interest rates of bonds with different maturities, is another key factor in determining interest rates. The yield curve is influenced by **inflation expectations**, with higher expected inflation leading to higher interest rates, as lenders demand higher returns to compensate for the expected loss of purchasing power. The **term premium**, which is the excess return demanded by lenders for holding a longer-term bond, also affects interest rates, with higher term premiums leading to higher interest rates. According to **Irving Fisher's** theory of interest, the nominal interest rate is equal to the real interest rate plus the expected inflation rate.

The **credit risk** of the borrower also affects the interest rate, with riskier borrowers being charged higher interest rates to compensate lenders for the higher likelihood of default. The **credit spread**, which is the difference between the interest rate charged to a borrower and the interest rate paid to a lender, is a key indicator of credit risk. For example, **Moody's** credit rating agency assigns credit ratings to borrowers based on their creditworthiness, with higher-rated borrowers being charged lower interest rates.

## Key Components
- **Nominal interest rate**: the interest rate that includes the effects of inflation, with higher nominal interest rates indicating higher expected inflation or higher credit risk.
- **Real interest rate**: the interest rate that excludes the effects of inflation, with higher real interest rates indicating higher returns to lenders.
- **Term premium**: the excess return demanded by lenders for holding a longer-term bond, with higher term premiums leading to higher interest rates.
- **Credit spread**: the difference between the interest rate charged to a borrower and the interest rate paid to a lender, with higher credit spreads indicating higher credit risk.
- **Liquidity premium**: the excess return demanded by lenders for holding a less liquid bond, with higher liquidity premiums leading to higher interest rates.
- **Inflation expectations**: the expected rate of inflation, with higher expected inflation leading to higher interest rates.

## Common Misconceptions
**Myth:** Higher interest rates always lead to lower borrowing and spending — **Fact:** Higher interest rates can lead to higher borrowing and spending if the economy is growing rapidly and borrowers are willing to pay higher interest rates to finance their investments, as seen in the **United States** during the 1990s.
**Myth:** Lower interest rates always lead to higher inflation — **Fact:** Lower interest rates can lead to lower inflation if the economy is in a recession and aggregate demand is low, as seen in **Japan** during the 1990s.
**Myth:** Interest rates are determined solely by the central bank — **Fact:** Interest rates are determined by the interaction of supply and demand in the loan market, with the central bank influencing interest rates through its monetary policy decisions, as described by **Milton Friedman's** monetarist theory.
**Myth:** Higher interest rates always lead to a stronger currency — **Fact:** Higher interest rates can lead to a weaker currency if the higher interest rates are due to higher inflation expectations or higher credit risk, as seen in **Argentina** during the 1990s.

## In Practice
The **European Central Bank** (ECB) has used **negative interest rates** to stimulate borrowing and spending in the **eurozone**, with the ECB charging banks a negative interest rate on their deposits in an effort to encourage them to lend more to customers. For example, in 2015, the ECB cut its deposit rate to -0.1%, which led to a significant increase in lending to households and businesses. Similarly, the **Bank of England** has used **quantitative easing** to lower interest rates and stimulate borrowing and spending in the **United Kingdom**, with the bank purchasing government bonds and other securities to inject liquidity into the financial system. According to **Bank of England** data, the bank's quantitative easing program has led to a significant increase in lending to households and businesses, with lending growth averaging 3.5% per annum between 2010 and 2015.
