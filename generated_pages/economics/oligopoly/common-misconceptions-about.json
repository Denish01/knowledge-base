  "content": "The most common misconception about oligopoly is that it is always characterized by **collusion** among firms to fix prices and restrict output. \n- **Myth:** Oligopoly always leads to higher prices and reduced output due to **collusion** among firms.\n- **Fact:** The Cournot model, developed by Antoine Augustin Cournot, shows that firms in an oligopoly can engage in **non-cooperative behavior**, leading to lower prices and increased output, as seen in the **US airline industry**, where competition among a few large carriers has driven down prices (US Department of Transportation).\n- **Source of confusion:** This myth persists due to the widespread coverage of price-fixing scandals in the media, which creates a narrative that oligopolies are inherently collusive.\n\n- **Myth:** Oligopolies are always composed of a small number of identical firms.\n- **Fact:** The **Bertrand model** demonstrates that oligopolies can consist of firms with different **cost structures** and **product offerings**, such as the **automobile industry**, where firms like Toyota and Ford have different production costs and product lines (Toyota annual report).\n- **Source of confusion:** Simplified textbook examples often assume identical firms, leading to a misunderstanding of the complexity of real-world oligopolies.\n\n- **Myth:** Oligopolies are always characterized by **barriers to entry**, which prevent new firms from entering the market.\n- **Fact:** The **Texas Instruments** case shows that new firms can enter an oligopolistic market if they have **innovative products** or **lower costs**, as seen in the **semiconductor industry**, where new firms have entered and competed with established players (Texas Instruments annual report).\n- **Source of confusion:** The assumption that oligopolies are always characterized by high barriers to entry stems from the **structuralist view** of oligopoly, which emphasizes the role of entry barriers in maintaining market power.\n\n- **Myth:** Oligopolies always lead to **inefficient allocation of resources**.\n- **Fact:** The **contestable markets theory**, developed by William Baumol, shows that oligopolies can lead to **efficient allocation of resources** if there is a threat of **potential entry** by new firms, as seen in the **telecommunications industry**, where the threat of entry by new firms has driven down prices and improved service quality (Baumol's contestable markets theory).\n- **Source of confusion:** The idea that oligopolies are inherently inefficient stems from the **traditional view** of oligopoly, which emphasizes the role of market power in leading to inefficiency.\n\n- **Myth:** Oligopolies are always characterized by **homogeneous products**.\n- **Fact:** The **product differentiation model**, developed by Chamberlin, shows that oligopolies can consist of firms offering **differentiated products**, such as the **coffee shop industry**, where firms like Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts offer distinct products and brand experiences (Chamberlin's product differentiation model).\n- **Source of confusion:** The assumption that oligopolies are always characterized by homogeneous products stems from the **simplistic view** of oligopoly, which neglects the importance of product differentiation in real-world markets.\n\n- **Myth:** Oligopolies always lead to **higher profits** for firms.\n- **Fact:** The **oligopoly model** of **Stackelberg** shows that oligopolies can lead to **lower profits** for firms if there is **intense competition**, as seen in the **steel industry**, where competition among a few large firms has driven down prices and reduced profits (Stackelberg's oligopoly model).\n- **Source of confusion:** The idea that oligopolies always lead to higher profits stems from the **naive view** of oligopoly, which neglects the importance of competition in determining firm profits.\n\n## Quick Reference\n- **Myth:** Oligopoly always leads to higher prices and reduced output \u2192 **Fact:** Cournot model shows non-cooperative behavior can lead to lower prices and increased output (US Department of Transportation).\n- **Myth:** Oligopolies are always composed of identical firms \u2192 **Fact:** Bertrand model demonstrates oligopolies can consist of firms with different cost structures and

products or lower costs (Texas Instruments annual report).\n- **Myth:** Oligopolies always lead to inefficient allocation of resources \u2192 **Fact:** Contestable markets theory shows oligopolies can lead to efficient allocation with threat of potential entry (Baumol's contestable markets theory).\n- **Myth:** Oligopolies are always characterized by homogeneous products \u2192 **Fact:** Product differentiation model shows oligopolies can consist of firms offering differentiated products (Chamberlin's product differentiation model).\n- **Myth:** Oligopolies always lead to higher profits \u2192 **Fact:** Stackelberg oligopoly model shows oligopolies can lead to lower profits with intense competition (Stackelberg's oligopoly model).",
