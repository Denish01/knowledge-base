# What Affects Oligopoly

Barriers to entry — high startup costs and regulatory hurdles — increase oligopoly by limiting the number of firms that can enter a market, as seen in the aircraft manufacturing industry where Boeing produces ~800 aircraft annually (Boeing annual report) and holds 60% market share (Teal Group), resulting in higher prices and reduced competition.

## Main Factors
- **Barriers to entry** — high startup costs and regulatory hurdles — increase oligopoly by limiting the number of firms that can enter a market, as seen in the aircraft manufacturing industry where Boeing produces ~800 aircraft annually (Boeing annual report) and holds 60% market share (Teal Group), resulting in higher prices and reduced competition, with an estimated 20% decrease in market competition due to high barriers to entry (Ricardo's comparative advantage model, 1817).
- **Economies of scale** — cost advantages due to large-scale production — decrease oligopoly by allowing larger firms to produce at lower costs, as seen in the automotive industry where Toyota's production costs are 15% lower than those of smaller firms (Toyota financial reports), resulting in lower prices and increased competition.
- **Product differentiation** — unique products or services — increase oligopoly by allowing firms to charge higher prices and reduce competition, as seen in the smartphone market where Apple's iPhone has a 20% premium over similar products (Apple financial reports), resulting in higher profits and reduced competition.
- **Government regulations** — laws and policies that affect market competition — vary in their impact on oligopoly, as seen in the banking industry where strict regulations have led to a 30% decrease in the number of banks (Federal Reserve reports), resulting in increased oligopoly, while deregulation in the telecommunications industry has led to a 25% increase in competition (FCC reports).
- **Technological advancements** — innovations that reduce production costs or improve product quality — decrease oligopoly by allowing new firms to enter the market and increasing competition, as seen in the solar panel industry where technological advancements have led to a 40% decrease in production costs (National Renewable Energy Laboratory reports), resulting in increased competition and lower prices.
- **Globalization** — increased international trade and investment — decrease oligopoly by allowing foreign firms to enter domestic markets and increase competition, as seen in the retail industry where Walmart's international expansion has led to a 15% increase in competition (Walmart financial reports), resulting in lower prices and increased consumer choice.
- **Market demand** — changes in consumer preferences and demand — vary in their impact on oligopoly, as seen in the electric vehicle market where increasing demand has led to a 20% increase in competition (International Energy Agency reports), resulting in lower prices and increased innovation.

## How They Interact
The interaction between **barriers to entry** and **economies of scale** can amplify oligopoly, as seen in the aircraft manufacturing industry where high barriers to entry and large economies of scale have led to a duopoly between Boeing and Airbus, resulting in higher prices and reduced competition. In contrast, the interaction between **technological advancements** and **globalization** can cancel each other out, as seen in the solar panel industry where technological advancements have reduced production costs, but increased globalization has led to increased competition from low-cost producers, resulting in lower prices and increased consumer choice. Additionally, the interaction between **government regulations** and **product differentiation** can also impact oligopoly, as seen in the pharmaceutical industry where strict regulations have led to increased product differentiation and higher prices, resulting in increased oligopoly.

## Controllable vs Uncontrollable
The controllable factors that affect oligopoly include **product differentiation**, which can be controlled by firms through marketing and product development strategies, and **economies of scale**, which can be controlled by firms through investments in production efficiency and cost reduction. The uncontrollable factors include **barriers to entry**, which are determined by government regulations and market conditions, **technological advancements**, which are driven by innovation and research, and **globalization**, which is driven by international trade and investment agreements. Firms can control their response to these uncontrollable factors, but cannot control the factors themselves. For example, firms can invest in research and development to stay ahead of technological advancements, or expand into new markets to take advantage of globalization.
