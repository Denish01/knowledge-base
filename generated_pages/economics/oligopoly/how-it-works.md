# How Oligopoly Works

Oligopoly is a market structure in which a small number of firms compete with each other, resulting in a **price leadership** model where one firm sets the price and others follow, as seen in the airline industry where American Airlines' pricing strategy influences the prices of Delta and United. The core mechanism of oligopoly involves a few large firms producing a **homogeneous product**, such as aluminum, where the output of one firm affects the market price, as evidenced by the 60% market share held by Alcoa in the 1950s.

## The Mechanism
The oligopoly mechanism is driven by the interaction between **firm output** and **market price**, where a change in output by one firm affects the market price, which in turn affects the output of other firms, as described by Ricardo's comparative advantage model. The process involves firms making output decisions based on their **marginal revenue** and **marginal cost**, resulting in a **Nash equilibrium** where no firm can improve its profit by unilaterally changing its output.

## Step-by-Step
1. Each firm in an oligopoly market determines its optimal output level by equating its **marginal revenue** to its **marginal cost**, resulting in an output of 10 million units for a firm like Boeing, which produces ~800 aircraft annually (Boeing annual report). The marginal revenue is affected by the market price, which is influenced by the output of other firms.
2. The output decision of one firm affects the market price, which in turn affects the output decision of other firms, as seen in the **kinked demand curve** model, where a price increase by one firm leads to a decrease in demand, while a price decrease leads to an increase in demand. For example, if Boeing increases its output by 10%, the market price may decrease by 5%, affecting the output decision of Airbus.
3. Firms in an oligopoly market engage in **non-price competition**, such as advertising and product differentiation, to increase their market share, as evidenced by the ~$1 billion advertising budget of Coca-Cola. This type of competition can lead to an increase in market share of 2-3% for a firm like Coca-Cola.
4. The oligopoly market structure leads to a **barrier to entry** for new firms, as the existing firms have a significant advantage in terms of **economies of scale** and **brand recognition**, making it difficult for new firms to compete, as seen in the 80% market share held by Google in the search engine market.
5. The interaction between firms in an oligopoly market can lead to **collusion**, where firms agree to fix prices or output levels, resulting in a **monopoly-like** market structure, as seen in the 1950s when General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler controlled 90% of the US automobile market.
6. The oligopoly market structure can also lead to **innovation** and **product development**, as firms compete to improve their products and services, resulting in an increase in product quality and a decrease in price, as seen in the smartphone market where Apple and Samsung compete to introduce new features and technologies.

## Key Components
- **Firm output**: The quantity of goods or services produced by each firm, which affects the market price and the output of other firms.
- **Market price**: The price at which goods or services are sold in the market, which is influenced by the output of firms and the demand for the product.
- **Marginal revenue**: The additional revenue earned by a firm from selling one more unit of output, which is used to determine the optimal output level.
- **Marginal cost**: The additional cost incurred by a firm from producing one more unit of output, which is used to determine the optimal output level.
- **Nash equilibrium**: A state where no firm can improve its profit by unilaterally changing its output, resulting in a stable market structure.

## Common Questions
What happens if one firm in an oligopoly market increases its output? The market price may decrease, affecting the output decision of other firms, as seen in the example of Boeing increasing its output by 10% and the market price decreasing by 5%. 
What is the effect of non-price competition in an oligopoly market? Non-price competition, such as advertising and product differentiation, can lead to an increase in market share of 2-3% for a firm like Coca-Cola. 
Can new firms enter an oligopoly market? The oligopoly market structure leads to a barrier to entry for new firms, as the existing firms have a significant advantage in terms of economies of scale and brand recognition, making it difficult for new firms to compete. 
How does collusion affect the oligopoly market structure? Collusion, where firms agree to fix prices or output levels, can result in a monopoly-like market structure, as seen in the 1950s when General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler controlled 90% of the US automobile market.
