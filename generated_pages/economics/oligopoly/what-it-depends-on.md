# What Oligopoly Depends On

Barriers to entry are the most critical dependency for an **oligopoly**, as they prevent new companies from entering the market and competing with existing firms, such as Boeing and Airbus in the aircraft manufacturing industry, where Boeing produces ~800 aircraft annually (Boeing annual report) and holds significant market power.

## Key Dependencies
- **Barriers to entry** — high startup costs, intellectual property rights, and regulatory hurdles prevent new companies from entering the market, allowing existing firms to maintain their market share and limit competition, as seen in the aircraft manufacturing industry where Boeing and Airbus have dominated the market for decades, with Boeing holding 60% market share (Teal Group).
- **Differentiated products** — unique features, branding, and marketing strategies distinguish one company's products from another's, enabling companies to charge premium prices and maintain customer loyalty, such as Coca-Cola's brand recognition and customer loyalty, which has allowed the company to maintain a significant market share in the beverage industry.
- **Information asymmetry** — unequal access to information among market participants can lead to inefficiencies and opportunities for companies to exploit, such as in the used car market where sellers have more information about the vehicle's condition than buyers, as described in Akerlof's market for lemons model.
- **Government policies** — regulations, subsidies, and taxes can influence the competitive landscape of an oligopoly, such as the US government's subsidies to farmers, which can affect the market power of companies like Archer Daniels Midland, as noted in Ricardo's comparative advantage model, 1817.
- **Network effects** — the value of a product or service increases as more users adopt it, creating a self-reinforcing cycle, such as in the case of Microsoft's Windows operating system, which became the industry standard due to its widespread adoption, leading to a significant market share.
- **Economies of scale** — large companies can reduce their costs per unit by producing more, making it difficult for smaller companies to compete, such as in the case of Walmart, which has achieved significant economies of scale through its large production volumes, allowing it to offer lower prices to customers.

## Priority Order
The dependencies can be ranked in the following order from most to least critical:
1. **Barriers to entry** - without high barriers to entry, new companies can easily enter the market and compete with existing firms, reducing their market power and profitability.
2. **Differentiated products** - unique products and branding are essential for companies to maintain customer loyalty and charge premium prices.
3. **Information asymmetry** - unequal access to information among market participants can lead to inefficiencies and opportunities for companies to exploit, but it is not as critical as barriers to entry and differentiated products.
4. **Government policies** - regulations and subsidies can influence the competitive landscape, but their impact can be mitigated by companies adapting to changes in government policies.
5. **Network effects** - while network effects can create a self-reinforcing cycle, they are not as critical as the first four dependencies, as companies can still compete without them.
6. **Economies of scale** - large companies can reduce their costs per unit, but smaller companies can still compete by focusing on niche markets or offering unique products.

## Common Gaps
People often overlook the importance of **information asymmetry** and **government policies** in shaping the competitive landscape of an oligopoly, assuming that companies can simply compete on price and quality, but in reality, these factors can significantly impact a company's market power and profitability, such as in the case of the US telecommunications industry, where regulatory changes have led to significant consolidation and reduced competition.
