# Example of Oligopoly

## Definition
Oligopoly refers to a market structure characterized by a small number of firms competing with each other, often resulting in limited competition and higher prices, as described by Cournot's oligopoly model, 1838.

## How It Works
In an oligopolistic market, a few large firms dominate the industry, and their actions have a significant impact on the market. For example, the global aircraft manufacturing industry is an oligopoly, with Boeing and Airbus controlling over 90% of the market, Boeing produces ~800 aircraft annually (Boeing annual report), while Airbus produces around 700 aircraft per year (Airbus annual report). This concentration of market power allows these firms to influence prices and output, often leading to reduced competition and higher prices for consumers. The **kinked demand curve** model, developed by Paul Sweezy, 1939, helps explain how oligopolistic firms make pricing decisions, taking into account the potential reactions of their competitors.

The oligopolistic market structure is often characterized by **barriers to entry**, which prevent new firms from entering the market. These barriers can include high startup costs, **economies of scale**, and **government regulations**. For instance, the pharmaceutical industry is an oligopoly, with high research and development costs and strict government regulations making it difficult for new firms to enter the market. The **Herfindahl-Hirschman Index** (HHI), developed by Orris Herfindahl and Albert Hirschman, is often used to measure the level of concentration in an oligopolistic market, with higher HHI values indicating a more concentrated market. In the US, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) uses the HHI to assess the level of competition in a market, with an HHI above 2500 indicating a highly concentrated market.

The oligopolistic market structure can also lead to **collusive behavior** among firms, where they cooperate to restrict output and increase prices. However, this behavior is often difficult to detect and can be unstable, as firms may have an incentive to cheat on the agreement. The **Nash equilibrium**, developed by John Nash, 1950, provides a framework for analyzing the strategic interactions between oligopolistic firms and predicting the outcomes of their actions. For example, in the US telecommunications industry, the four major firms (Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, and Sprint) have been accused of colluding to limit competition and increase prices, with the FTC investigating their practices.

## Key Components
- **Market concentration**: The degree to which a small number of firms dominate the market, often measured by the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI). An increase in market concentration can lead to higher prices and reduced competition.
- **Barriers to entry**: The obstacles that prevent new firms from entering the market, such as high startup costs, economies of scale, and government regulations. An increase in barriers to entry can reduce competition and increase prices.
- **Economies of scale**: The cost advantages that large firms enjoy due to their size, such as lower production costs and improved efficiency. An increase in economies of scale can lead to lower costs and higher profits for large firms.
- **Product differentiation**: The degree to which firms' products are differentiated from each other, often through branding, advertising, and quality differences. An increase in product differentiation can lead to higher prices and reduced competition.
- **Government regulations**: The rules and laws that govern the market, such as antitrust laws and industry-specific regulations. An increase in government regulations can reduce competition and increase prices.
- **Strategic interactions**: The actions and reactions of firms in an oligopolistic market, often analyzed using game theory and the Nash equilibrium. An increase in strategic interactions can lead to more complex and unstable market outcomes.

## Common Misconceptions
- **Myth:** Oligopolies always lead to higher prices and reduced competition. **Fact:** While oligopolies can lead to higher prices, they can also lead to increased efficiency and innovation, as firms compete through product differentiation and advertising, as seen in the US automobile industry, where firms like General Motors and Ford compete through branding and quality differences.
- **Myth:** Oligopolies are always unstable and prone to collusion. **Fact:** While oligopolies can be unstable, they can also be stable, as firms may have an incentive to cooperate and maintain a collusive agreement, as seen in the OPEC oil cartel, which has maintained a stable agreement among its member countries for decades.
- **Myth:** Oligopolies are always bad for consumers. **Fact:** While oligopolies can lead to higher prices, they can also lead to increased innovation and product variety, as firms compete to attract consumers, as seen in the US technology industry, where firms like Apple and Google compete through innovation and product differentiation.
- **Myth:** Government regulations always reduce competition in oligopolistic markets. **Fact:** While government regulations can reduce competition, they can also increase competition, as seen in the US telecommunications industry, where regulations have led to increased competition and lower prices.

## In Practice
The US airline industry is a classic example of an oligopoly, with four major firms (American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, and Southwest Airlines) controlling over 80% of the market. These firms engage in strategic interactions, such as pricing and capacity adjustments, to compete with each other. The industry is also characterized by high barriers to entry, including high startup costs and strict government regulations. The **Civil Aeronautics Board** (CAB) regulates the industry, setting rules for safety, pricing, and competition. In 2019, the four major airlines generated over $140 billion in revenue, with an average profit margin of around 10% (Bureau of Transportation Statistics). The oligopolistic structure of the industry has led to increased efficiency and innovation, as firms compete through product differentiation and advertising, but has also raised concerns about reduced competition and higher prices for consumers.
