# Types of Bear Market

There are three primary categories of bear markets, classified based on their duration and underlying economic conditions. 
## Main Categories
- **Cyclical Bear Market** — a short-term bear market that occurs during an economic downturn, characterized by a decline in stock prices and economic activity, as seen in the 1990 bear market triggered by the Gulf War and subsequent recession, which affected companies like **General Motors**.
- **Secular Bear Market** — a long-term bear market that lasts for several years or even decades, marked by a persistent decline in stock prices and economic stagnation, exemplified by the 1966-1982 bear market in the United States, which impacted the growth of companies like **Coca-Cola**.
- **Event-Driven Bear Market** — a bear market triggered by a specific event or crisis, such as a war, natural disaster, or financial crisis, characterized by a sudden and sharp decline in stock prices, as illustrated by the 2020 bear market caused by the **COVID-19 pandemic**, which severely affected the stock price of companies like **Norwegian Cruise Line**.

## Comparison Table
| Category | Duration | Causes | Impact on Stock Prices |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cyclical Bear Market | Short-term (less than 2 years) | Economic downturn, recession | Sharp decline (10-20%) |
| Secular Bear Market | Long-term (several years or decades) | Economic stagnation, structural issues | Persistent decline (20-50%) |
| Event-Driven Bear Market | Variable (depending on the event) | Specific event or crisis | Sudden and sharp decline (10-50%) |

## How They Relate
The categories of bear markets are not mutually exclusive, and they can overlap or feed into each other. For example, a cyclical bear market can be triggered by an event-driven bear market, as seen in the 2008 financial crisis, where the initial event-driven bear market caused by the housing market bubble burst led to a cyclical bear market. Similarly, a secular bear market can be the result of a prolonged cyclical bear market, as witnessed in the 1970s, where the combination of high inflation and economic stagnation led to a long-term decline in stock prices. The distinction between these categories is crucial, as it can inform investment strategies and help investors navigate different market conditions. Specifically, the pairing of **cyclical and event-driven bear markets** can be particularly challenging, as the sudden onset of an event-driven bear market can exacerbate the decline in stock prices during a cyclical bear market, while the combination of **secular and cyclical bear markets** can lead to a prolonged period of economic stagnation and decline in stock prices.
