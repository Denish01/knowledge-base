# Example of Scarcity

1. INTRODUCTION
Scarcity refers to the limited availability of a resource, good, or service. It occurs when the demand for something exceeds its supply, resulting in a shortage. Scarcity can be observed in various aspects of life, from everyday situations to global issues. Understanding scarcity is essential to make informed decisions about how to allocate resources efficiently.

2. EVERYDAY EXAMPLES
In daily life, scarcity can be seen in many situations. For instance, a popular restaurant in a small town may have limited seating capacity, leading to long waiting times during peak hours. This is an example of scarcity because the demand for tables exceeds the available supply. Another example is the limited number of tickets available for a concert of a famous musician. When the tickets go on sale, they often sell out quickly, leaving many fans without tickets. This is a classic case of scarcity, where the demand for tickets exceeds the supply. Additionally, a small business may face scarcity when it comes to skilled labor, as there may be a limited number of qualified candidates available for a specific job. A family may also experience scarcity when it comes to their monthly budget, as they may have to make tough decisions about how to allocate their limited financial resources.

3. NOTABLE EXAMPLES
Historically, notable examples of scarcity include the shortage of food during times of famine, such as the Irish Potato Famine, where the limited availability of food led to widespread poverty and starvation. Another example is the scarcity of oil during the 1970s, which led to increased prices and rationing. The diamond industry is also a well-known example of scarcity, where the limited supply of diamonds is carefully managed to maintain high prices. The scarcity of diamonds is artificially maintained by the De Beers company, which controls a significant portion of the diamond market.

4. EDGE CASES
In some cases, scarcity can occur in unexpected ways. For example, a small island nation may experience scarcity of fresh water due to its limited land area and lack of rainfall. This can lead to the implementation of strict water conservation measures and the use of desalination plants to increase the supply of fresh water. Another example is the scarcity of certain medications in developing countries, where the limited availability of these medications can have severe consequences for public health.

5. NON-EXAMPLES
Some situations are often mistaken for scarcity but do not actually qualify. For instance, a high price for a luxury item, such as a designer handbag, is not an example of scarcity. The high price is simply a result of the brand's marketing strategy and the item's perceived value. Another example is a temporary delay in the delivery of a product, which may be inconvenient but does not constitute scarcity. A third example is the limited availability of a product during a promotional period, which is a marketing tactic rather than a genuine case of scarcity.

6. PATTERN
Despite the varying contexts and scales, all valid examples of scarcity share a common pattern. They all involve a situation where the demand for a resource, good, or service exceeds its available supply. This imbalance between demand and supply leads to a shortage, which can have significant consequences. Whether it is a small business struggling to find qualified employees or a global shortage of a critical resource, the underlying principle of scarcity remains the same. By recognizing this pattern, individuals and organizations can better understand the challenges posed by scarcity and develop effective strategies to manage and allocate resources efficiently.
