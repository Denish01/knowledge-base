# What Perfect Competition Depends On

Perfect competition depends on **Free Entry and Exit**, as it allows firms to enter or exit the market as they see fit, which is critical for maintaining competitive pressure and preventing monopolies, as seen in the case of the US airline industry where the absence of free entry led to high prices and poor service before deregulation in 1978.

## Key Dependencies
- **Free Entry and Exit** — required to prevent monopolies and maintain competitive pressure, as the absence of free entry in the US airline industry before 1978 led to high prices and poor service, with the Civil Aeronautics Board limiting the number of airlines and routes, resulting in a lack of competition and innovation.
- **Homogeneous Products** — necessary for firms to compete on price, as the presence of differentiated products in the US automobile industry has led to a focus on non-price competition, such as advertising and product features, which can drive up costs and reduce competition, as seen in the case of General Motors and Ford.
- **Perfect Information** — critical for firms and consumers to make informed decisions, as the absence of perfect information in the US housing market led to a bubble and subsequent crash in 2008, with many homeowners and investors making decisions based on incomplete or inaccurate information.
- **No Externalities** — required to prevent firms from imposing costs on others, as the presence of negative externalities in the US coal industry has led to significant environmental and health costs, with the absence of effective regulation allowing firms to externalize these costs and reduce their competitiveness.
- **No Government Intervention** — necessary to prevent government policies from distorting the market, as the presence of government subsidies in the US agricultural industry has led to overproduction and trade disputes, with the subsidies distorting the market and reducing competition.

## Priority Order
The dependencies can be ranked in the following order from most to least critical:
- **Free Entry and Exit**, as it is the most critical dependency for maintaining competitive pressure and preventing monopolies.
- **Perfect Information**, as it is necessary for firms and consumers to make informed decisions and for the market to function efficiently.
- **Homogeneous Products**, as it is necessary for firms to compete on price and for the market to be competitive.
- **No Externalities**, as it is necessary to prevent firms from imposing costs on others and to ensure that the market is functioning efficiently.
- **No Government Intervention**, as it is necessary to prevent government policies from distorting the market and reducing competition, but it is less critical than the other dependencies as some government intervention may be necessary to correct market failures.

## Common Gaps
People often overlook or take for granted the assumption of **Perfect Information**, assuming that firms and consumers have access to all relevant information, which can lead to market failures and inefficiencies, as seen in the case of the US housing market bubble and crash in 2008, where many homeowners and investors made decisions based on incomplete or inaccurate information.
