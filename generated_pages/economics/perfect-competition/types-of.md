# Types of Perfect Competition

There are four main categories of perfect competition, organized by the degree of market structure and the nature of competition: **Pure Competition**, **Monopolistic Competition**, **Oligopolistic Competition**, and **Monopsonistic Competition**.

## Main Categories
- **Pure Competition** — a market structure characterized by a large number of firms producing a homogeneous product, with free entry and exit, and no single firm having the power to influence the market price, as seen in the **New York Stock Exchange**.
- **Monopolistic Competition** — a market structure in which many firms produce differentiated products, leading to downward-sloping demand curves and allowing firms to have some degree of price-setting power, as exemplified by **Coca-Cola**.
- **Oligopolistic Competition** — a market structure dominated by a small number of large firms, where the actions of one firm can affect the others, and firms may engage in non-price competition, as illustrated by **Boeing** and **Airbus** in the aircraft manufacturing industry.
- **Monopsonistic Competition** — a market structure in which a single buyer or a small number of buyers have the power to influence the market price, often seen in labor markets where a single employer or a small number of employers have significant market power, as in the case of **Walmart** in certain local labor markets.

## Comparison Table
| Category | Number of Firms | Product Differentiation | Price-Setting Power |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Pure Competition** | Many | Homogeneous | None |
| **Monopolistic Competition** | Many | Differentiated | Some |
| **Oligopolistic Competition** | Few | Differentiated or Homogeneous | Significant |
| **Monopsonistic Competition** | One or Few | N/A | Significant |

## How They Relate
The categories of perfect competition overlap and feed into each other in complex ways. For example, **Monopolistic Competition** and **Oligopolistic Competition** can coexist in the same market, with firms competing through both price and non-price means. **Pure Competition** and **Monopolistic Competition** can also coexist, as firms in a purely competitive market may still differentiate their products to some extent. Additionally, **Oligopolistic Competition** and **Monopsonistic Competition** can be related, as a firm with significant market power in an oligopolistic market may also have significant power in the labor market, as in the case of **Amazon**. The pairs **Pure Competition** and **Monopsonistic Competition** are often confused, but they represent opposite ends of the market structure spectrum, with **Pure Competition** characterized by many firms and no market power, and **Monopsonistic Competition** characterized by a single buyer or a small number of buyers with significant market power.
