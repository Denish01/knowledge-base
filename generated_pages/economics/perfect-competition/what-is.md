# What Is Perfect Competition?

## Definition
Perfect competition is a market structure characterized by many firms producing a homogeneous product, with no single firm having the power to influence the market price, as described by Frank Knight in 1921.

## How It Works
Perfect competition is based on the idea that many firms are producing a similar product, and no single firm can control the market price. This is because each firm is a **price taker**, meaning they accept the market price as given. The market price is determined by the intersection of the market demand and supply curves, with firms adjusting their production levels to maximize profits. For example, in the agricultural industry, many farmers produce wheat, and the market price of wheat is determined by the overall supply and demand for wheat, not by any individual farmer. Ricardo's comparative advantage model, 1817, also supports the idea of perfect competition, as it suggests that countries should specialize in producing goods for which they have a lower opportunity cost.

The **law of one price** also holds in perfect competition, where the price of a homogeneous product is the same across all firms. This is because if one firm were to charge a higher price, consumers would simply buy from another firm at the lower price. The firm would then be forced to lower its price to remain competitive. In the US airline industry, for instance, many airlines compete with each other, and the price of a flight from New York to Los Angeles is similar across all airlines. Boeing produces ~800 aircraft annually (Boeing annual report), and the market for aircraft is highly competitive, with many firms producing similar products.

The **entry and exit** of firms in a perfectly competitive market also play a crucial role in determining the market price. If firms are making economic profits, new firms will enter the market, increasing the supply of the product and driving down the price. Conversely, if firms are making economic losses, some firms will exit the market, reducing the supply of the product and driving up the price. In the US coffee shop industry, for example, many independent coffee shops have entered the market in recent years, increasing competition and driving down prices. Starbucks, which holds a significant market share, has responded by expanding its product offerings and improving its customer service.

## Key Components
- **Homogeneous products**: Firms produce identical products, making it easy for consumers to switch between firms. If the products become more differentiated, firms may be able to charge higher prices and increase their market share.
- **Free entry and exit**: Firms can enter or exit the market as they wish, which helps to eliminate economic profits and losses. If entry and exit become more difficult, firms may be able to maintain economic profits for longer periods.
- **Many firms**: There are many firms in the market, each with a small market share. If the number of firms decreases, the remaining firms may be able to increase their market share and charge higher prices.
- **Perfect information**: Consumers and firms have complete knowledge of market conditions, including prices and product quality. If information becomes less perfect, firms may be able to charge higher prices or reduce product quality.
- **No externalities**: The production and consumption of the product do not affect third parties. If externalities become significant, firms may need to internalize them, which can increase their costs and reduce their profitability.
- **No government intervention**: The government does not intervene in the market, allowing firms to operate freely. If the government imposes regulations or taxes, firms may need to adjust their production levels and pricing strategies.

## Common Misconceptions
**Myth:** Perfect competition is a realistic market structure that can be found in many industries — **Fact:** Perfect competition is an idealized market structure that is rarely found in reality, as most industries have some degree of differentiation or barriers to entry. The US airline industry, for example, has a high degree of competition, but firms still have some ability to differentiate their products and charge higher prices.
**Myth:** Firms in a perfectly competitive market are guaranteed to make economic profits — **Fact:** Firms in a perfectly competitive market will only make normal profits in the long run, as economic profits will attract new firms and drive down the market price. Boeing, for instance, has experienced fluctuations in profitability over the years due to changes in demand and competition.
**Myth:** Perfect competition leads to the most efficient allocation of resources — **Fact:** While perfect competition can lead to an efficient allocation of resources in some cases, it can also lead to overproduction or underproduction of certain goods. The US agricultural industry, for example, has been criticized for overproducing certain crops, leading to waste and inefficiency.
**Myth:** Perfect competition is the only market structure that leads to consumer surplus — **Fact:** Other market structures, such as monopolistic competition, can also lead to consumer surplus, as firms differentiate their products and compete on quality and price. Apple, for instance, has created significant consumer surplus through its innovative products and branding.

## In Practice
In the US agricultural industry, perfect competition can be observed in the market for wheat. Many farmers produce wheat, and the market price is determined by the overall supply and demand for wheat. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) reports that the US produces over 2 billion bushels of wheat annually, with the majority being produced by small and medium-sized farms. The market price of wheat is highly competitive, with firms such as Cargill and Archer Daniels Midland competing to buy wheat from farmers. The USDA also provides subsidies to farmers to support their production, which can affect the market price and the profitability of farming. In 2020, the USDA provided over $10 billion in subsidies to farmers, which helped to support the production of wheat and other crops.
