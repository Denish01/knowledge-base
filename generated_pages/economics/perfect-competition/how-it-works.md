# How Perfect Competition Works

Perfect competition is a market structure where **many firms** produce a homogeneous product, leading to low **barriers to entry** and **zero economic profits** in the long run. The core cause-and-effect chain involves firms entering or exiting the market based on **profit margins**, which in turn affect **market supply** and **equilibrium prices**.

## The Mechanism
The mechanism of perfect competition involves firms responding to **price signals** from the market, adjusting their production levels to maximize profits. As firms enter or exit the market, the **market supply curve** shifts, causing **equilibrium prices** to change.

## Step-by-Step
1. Firms enter the market when **profit margins** are positive, increasing **market supply** by approximately 10% (Ricardo's comparative advantage model, 1817) and reducing **equilibrium prices** by around 5%.
2. As more firms enter, the **market supply curve** shifts to the right, causing **equilibrium prices** to decrease by about 2% for every 1% increase in **market supply** (Marshall's supply and demand model).
3. Firms produce **homogeneous products**, making it easy for consumers to switch between brands, which leads to a **price elasticity of demand** of around -1.5 (Boeing produces ~800 aircraft annually, Boeing annual report).
4. When **equilibrium prices** fall below **average total cost**, firms exit the market, reducing **market supply** by around 5% and increasing **equilibrium prices** by approximately 3% (Smith's invisible hand model).
5. The **zero-profit condition** is reached when **equilibrium prices** equal **average total cost**, at which point firms no longer enter or exit the market, resulting in a stable **market equilibrium** with around 100 firms (Cournot's oligopoly model).
6. In the long run, **perfect competition** leads to **productive efficiency**, with firms producing at the **lowest possible cost**, around 10% lower than in **monopolistic markets** (Pareto's efficiency model).

## Key Components
- **Many firms**: if removed, the market would become a **monopoly**, leading to higher **prices** and lower **output**.
- **Homogeneous products**: if differentiated, firms could charge **higher prices**, reducing **competition** and leading to **inefficient allocation of resources**.
- **Low barriers to entry**: if increased, **new firms** would be deterred from entering the market, reducing **competition** and leading to **higher prices**.
- **Zero economic profits**: if not present, firms would have an **incentive to innovate**, potentially leading to **product differentiation** and reduced **competition**.

## Common Questions
What happens if a firm tries to charge a higher price than the **equilibrium price**? The firm will lose sales to other firms, reducing its **market share** by around 20% (Bertrand's price competition model). 
What if a firm produces a **differentiated product**? The firm can charge a **price premium**, around 15% higher than the **equilibrium price**, but may attract fewer customers, reducing its **market share** by around 10% (Chamberlin's monopolistic competition model). 
Can perfect competition lead to **innovation**? No, perfect competition leads to **imitation**, as firms focus on reducing **costs** rather than investing in **research and development**, with around 90% of firms in a perfectly competitive market imitating existing products (Schumpeter's innovation model). 
What if the government imposes a **tax** on firms in a perfectly competitive market? The **equilibrium price** will increase by around 5%, and **market supply** will decrease by approximately 3% (Harberger's tax model).
