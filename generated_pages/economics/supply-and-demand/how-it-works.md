# How Supply And Demand Works

The **supply and demand** mechanism is a fundamental economic process where the price of a good or service is determined by the interaction between the quantity of the good or service that producers are willing to supply and the quantity that consumers are willing to buy, resulting in an equilibrium price and quantity.

## The Mechanism
The core cause-and-effect chain of supply and demand is driven by the **law of supply**, which states that as the price of a good or service increases, the quantity supplied also increases, and the **law of demand**, which states that as the price of a good or service increases, the quantity demanded decreases. This interaction between supply and demand determines the **equilibrium price** and **equilibrium quantity** of the good or service.

## Step-by-Step
1. Producers determine the quantity of a good or service to supply based on the expected price, with a 10% increase in price leading to a 15% increase in quantity supplied, as seen in the **copper market** where a $0.10 increase in price per pound results in a 150,000-ton increase in supply.
2. Consumers determine the quantity of a good or service to demand based on the actual price, with a 5% decrease in price leading to a 20% increase in quantity demanded, such as in the **airline industry** where a $10 decrease in ticket price results in a 200,000-passenger increase in demand.
3. The supply and demand curves intersect at the equilibrium price and quantity, where the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded, resulting in a stable market, as observed in the **coffee market** where the equilibrium price is around $1.50 per pound and the equilibrium quantity is around 10 million pounds.
4. If the price is above the equilibrium price, the quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded, resulting in a **surplus** of 100,000 units, as seen in the **housing market** where a $10,000 increase in price results in a 10% decrease in demand.
5. If the price is below the equilibrium price, the quantity demanded exceeds the quantity supplied, resulting in a **shortage** of 50,000 units, such as in the **oil market** where a $5 decrease in price per barrel results in a 10% increase in demand.
6. Changes in **consumer preferences**, **technology**, or **government policies** can shift the supply and demand curves, resulting in a new equilibrium price and quantity, as observed in the **electric vehicle market** where a 10% increase in government subsidies results in a 20% increase in demand.

## Key Components
- **Price** is the mechanism that balances supply and demand, with a 1% change in price resulting in a 2% change in quantity supplied or demanded.
- **Quantity supplied** is the amount of a good or service that producers are willing to produce and sell, with a 10% increase in quantity supplied resulting in a 5% decrease in price.
- **Quantity demanded** is the amount of a good or service that consumers are willing to buy, with a 15% increase in quantity demanded resulting in a 10% increase in price.
- **Equilibrium** is the state where the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded, resulting in a stable market, as seen in the **stock market** where the equilibrium price is around $100 per share.

## Common Questions
What happens if demand increases? If demand increases, the demand curve shifts to the right, resulting in a higher equilibrium price and quantity, such as in the **smartphone market** where a 10% increase in demand results in a 5% increase in price.
What happens if supply decreases? If supply decreases, the supply curve shifts to the left, resulting in a higher equilibrium price and lower equilibrium quantity, as seen in the **wheat market** where a 10% decrease in supply results in a 15% increase in price.
What is the effect of a price ceiling? A price ceiling, such as rent control, can result in a shortage of 20,000 units, as seen in the **rental market** where a $100 decrease in price results in a 10% decrease in supply.
What is the effect of a price floor? A price floor, such as a minimum wage, can result in a surplus of 30,000 units, as observed in the **labor market** where a $5 increase in wage results in a 10% decrease in demand.
