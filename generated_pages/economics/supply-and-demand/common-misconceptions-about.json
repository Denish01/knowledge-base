  "content": "The most common misconception about supply and demand is that **price** is the sole determinant of demand, with many believing that higher prices always lead to lower demand.\n\n## Misconceptions\n- **Myth:** Higher prices always lead to lower demand.\n- **Fact:** Boeing's commercial aircraft division has seen significant demand even with price increases, with the company producing ~800 aircraft annually (Boeing annual report), and Ricardo's comparative advantage model (1817) explains how countries like China can maintain demand for exports despite rising labor costs.\n- **Source of confusion:** This myth persists due to oversimplification of demand curves in introductory economics textbooks, which often ignore factors like income and substitution effects.\n- **Myth:** Supply and demand are always in equilibrium.\n- **Fact:** The 2008 housing market crash in the United States demonstrated a significant imbalance between supply and demand, with housing supply exceeding demand by over 2 million units (National Association of Realtors), and this imbalance was exacerbated by speculation, as described by Keynes' animal spirits concept.\n- **Source of confusion:** The myth of perpetual equilibrium stems from the common presentation of supply and demand as static, rather than dynamic, concepts in many economics courses.\n- **Myth:** Demand is always downward-sloping.\n- **Fact:** The demand curve for certain goods, like luxury items or status symbols, can be upward-sloping, as seen in the case of Veblen goods, where higher prices increase demand, such as with designer handbags (Veblen, 1899).\n- **Source of confusion:** This misconception arises from the common assumption that all goods follow the law of demand, without considering exceptions like prestige goods or Giffen goods.\n- **Myth:** Supply and demand are independent of each other.\n- **Fact:** The supply of oil is closely tied to demand, as changes in demand can affect the profitability of oil extraction and thus influence supply, as demonstrated by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' (OPEC) production decisions, which consider both supply and demand factors.\n- **Source of confusion:** This myth persists due to the separate analysis of supply and demand curves, rather than considering their interdependence in the context of market dynamics.\n- **Myth:** Prices always reflect the true value of a good.\n- **Fact:** Market prices can be influenced by factors like speculation, misinformation, and externalities, as seen in the Dutch tulip bubble, where prices became detached from the true value of the goods (Kindleberger, 1978).\n- **Source of confusion:** This myth arises from the assumption of perfect information and rationality in markets, which is not always the case in reality.\n- **Myth:** Supply and demand are only relevant in perfect markets.\n- **Fact:** Imperfect markets, like those with externalities or information asymmetry, still exhibit supply and demand dynamics, as demonstrated by the market for pollution permits, which exists despite the presence of externalities (Coase, 1960).\n- **Source of confusion:** The myth that supply and demand only apply to perfect markets stems from the common focus on idealized market models in economics education.\n\n## Quick Reference\n- Higher prices lead to lower demand \u2192 Boeing's aircraft sales have remained strong despite price increases (Boeing annual report)\n- Supply and demand are always in equilibrium \u2192 The 2008 housing market crash showed significant supply-demand imbalance (National Association of Realtors)\n- Demand is always downward-sloping \u2192 Luxury goods like designer handbags can have upward-sloping demand curves (Veblen, 1899)\n- Supply and demand are independent \u2192 OPEC's production decisions consider both supply and demand factors\n- Prices always reflect true value \u2192 The Dutch tulip bubble showed prices can become detached from true value (Kindleberger, 1978)\n- Supply and demand only apply to perfect markets \u2192 The market for pollution permits exhibits supply and demand dynamics despite externalities (Coase, 1960)",
