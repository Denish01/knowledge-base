# What Affects Comparative Advantage

Labor costs are the single biggest factor affecting **comparative advantage**, as they directly influence production costs and, consequently, the price of goods in the international market.

## Main Factors
- **Economies of scale** — as production increases, costs decrease, increasing comparative advantage; Boeing's large-scale production allows it to produce aircraft at a lower cost per unit, with Boeing producing ~800 aircraft annually (Boeing annual report), resulting in a 20% cost reduction compared to smaller manufacturers.
- **Technological advancements** — improvements in technology increase efficiency and reduce production costs, increasing comparative advantage; the adoption of automation in the manufacturing process has increased productivity by 30% at Toyota's plants (Toyota annual report), enabling the company to produce vehicles at a lower cost.
- **Transportation costs** — lower transportation costs decrease the cost of exporting goods, increasing comparative advantage; China's investment in its transportation infrastructure has reduced shipping costs by 15% (World Trade Organization), making its exports more competitive in the global market.
- **Trade policies** — tariffs and other trade barriers can decrease comparative advantage by increasing the cost of exports; the US tariffs on Chinese goods have increased the cost of Chinese exports by 25% (US Trade Representative), reducing China's comparative advantage in the US market.
- **Resource availability** — abundance of natural resources can increase comparative advantage by reducing production costs; Australia's large iron ore reserves have enabled it to become a low-cost producer, with iron ore production costs 30% lower than in other major producing countries (Australian Bureau of Statistics).
- **Human capital** — a skilled and educated workforce can increase comparative advantage by increasing productivity; Singapore's high investment in education has resulted in a 40% higher productivity rate compared to other countries in the region (Singapore Ministry of Education), enabling it to maintain a strong comparative advantage in the technology sector.
- **Government subsidies** — subsidies can increase comparative advantage by reducing production costs; the European Union's subsidies to farmers have reduced production costs by 20% (European Commission), enabling EU farmers to compete more effectively in the global market.

## How They Interact
The interaction between **labor costs** and **technological advancements** can amplify each other, as technological advancements can reduce labor costs and increase productivity; for example, the adoption of automation in the manufacturing process at Volkswagen's plants has reduced labor costs by 25% (Volkswagen annual report) and increased productivity by 35% (Volkswagen annual report). The interaction between **trade policies** and **transportation costs** can also cancel each other out, as lower transportation costs can offset the negative effects of trade barriers; for example, the reduction in shipping costs due to the expansion of the Panama Canal has offset the negative effects of US tariffs on Chinese goods, enabling Chinese exporters to maintain their competitive edge in the US market.

## Controllable vs Uncontrollable
The controllable factors affecting comparative advantage include **technological advancements**, controlled by companies through investment in research and development, and **trade policies**, controlled by governments through the imposition of tariffs and other trade barriers. Companies can invest in technological advancements to reduce production costs and increase productivity, while governments can impose trade policies to protect domestic industries or increase revenue. Uncontrollable factors include **resource availability**, which is determined by natural endowments, and **labor costs**, which are influenced by a range of factors, including government policies and demographic trends. While companies and governments can influence labor costs through policies such as minimum wage laws and immigration policies, they cannot fully control them.
