  "content": "Comparative advantage depends on **Relative Labor Productivity**, which determines the opportunity cost of producing a good or service in one country compared to another. \n\n## Key Dependencies\n- **Specialization** \u2014 without it, countries would not be able to focus on producing goods and services in which they have a comparative advantage, leading to inefficiencies in production; for instance, if the United States were to try to be self-sufficient in all industries, its overall productivity would suffer, as seen in the case of the Soviet Union's failed attempts at self-sufficiency.\n- **Free Trade** \u2014 the absence of free trade leads to tariffs and other trade barriers, which increase the cost of importing goods and services, thereby reducing the benefits of comparative advantage; a notable example is the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, which exacerbated the Great Depression by sparking a global trade war.\n- **Factor Endowments** \u2014 differences in factor endowments, such as labor, capital, and natural resources, are necessary for countries to have different opportunity costs and thus comparative advantages; if all countries had identical factor endowments, there would be no basis for trade, as illustrated by the lack of trade between identical countries in the Heckscher-Ohlin model.\n- **Transportation Costs** \u2014 high transportation costs can negate the benefits of comparative advantage by increasing the cost of importing goods and services; for example, the high cost of transporting goods to and from landlocked countries like Bolivia can make it difficult for them to take advantage of their comparative advantage in certain industries.\n- **Institutional Framework** \u2014 a stable and efficient institutional framework is necessary to facilitate trade and investment, without which countries may not be able to realize their comparative advantage; a case in point is the difficulty faced by investors in countries with weak property rights, such as Venezuela, where the absence of a stable institutional framework has discouraged investment and hindered trade.\n- **Market Size** \u2014 a large market size can provide opportunities for countries to specialize and take advantage of their comparative advantage, as seen in the case of China, where a large and growing market has enabled the country to become a major manufacturer and exporter of goods.\n\n## Priority Order\nThe dependencies can be ranked in the following order from most to least critical: \n- **Specialization**, as it is the foundation of comparative advantage and allows countries to focus on producing goods and services in which they have a relative advantage.\n- **Free Trade**, as it enables countries to take advantage of their comparative advantage by exchanging goods and services with other countries.\n- **Factor Endowments**, as they provide the basis for countries to have different opportunity costs and thus comparative advantages.\n- **Institutional Framework**, as it facilitates trade and investment, and is necessary for countries to realize their comparative advantage.\n- **Transportation Costs**, as high costs can negate the benefits of comparative advantage, but are not as critical as the other dependencies.\n- **Market Size**, as while a large market can provide opportunities for specialization, it is not as essential as the other dependencies.\n\n## Common Gaps\nPeople often overlook the importance of **Institutional Framework** and **Transportation Costs**, assuming that these factors are already in place or that their impact is negligible; however, the absence of a stable institutional framework and high transportation costs can significantly reduce the benefits of comparative advantage, as seen in the cases of countries with weak institutions and high transportation costs, such as Somalia and the Democratic Republic of Congo, respectively.",
