  "content": "There are four main categories of **Opportunity Cost**, which are organized based on the type of trade-off involved: **Direct Opportunity Cost**, **Indirect Opportunity Cost**, **Social Opportunity Cost**, and **Environmental Opportunity Cost**.\n\n## Main Categories\n- **Direct Opportunity Cost** \u2014 refers to the cost of choosing one option over another, where the trade-off is immediate and direct, such as when a company like Boeing decides to allocate its resources to produce more commercial aircraft, thereby forgoing the opportunity to produce more military aircraft (Boeing annual report).\n- **Indirect Opportunity Cost** \u2014 involves a trade-off that is not immediately apparent, such as when a country like Australia imposes tariffs on imported goods, which can lead to higher prices and reduced consumer choice, thereby increasing the indirect opportunity cost of consuming those goods (Ricardo's comparative advantage model, 1817).\n- **Social Opportunity Cost** \u2014 arises when a decision affects not only the individual or organization making the choice but also the broader community, such as when a company like Facebook prioritizes profit over user privacy, leading to a social opportunity cost in terms of reduced trust and potential social harm (World Health Organization).\n- **Environmental Opportunity Cost** \u2014 occurs when human activities lead to environmental degradation, such as when the production of palm oil leads to deforestation, resulting in a loss of biodiversity and increased greenhouse gas emissions, thereby increasing the environmental opportunity cost of consuming products containing palm oil (United Nations Environment Programme).\n\n## Comparison Table\n| Category | Cost | Scale | Risk |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Direct Opportunity Cost** | High | Small | Low |\n| **Indirect Opportunity Cost** | Medium | Medium | Medium |\n| **Social Opportunity Cost** | Low | Large | High |\n| **Environmental Opportunity Cost** | High | Global | Very High |\n\n## How They Relate\nThe categories of opportunity cost often overlap and feed into each other, such as when a company's decision to prioritize profit over environmental sustainability leads to both a **Direct Opportunity Cost** (in terms of forgoing more sustainable practices) and an **Environmental Opportunity Cost** (in terms of contributing to environmental degradation). Similarly, a country's decision to impose tariffs on imported goods can lead to both an **Indirect Opportunity Cost** (in terms of higher prices and reduced consumer choice) and a **Social Opportunity Cost** (in terms of reduced economic growth and potential social harm). Specific pairs of categories that are commonly confused include **Direct Opportunity Cost** and **Indirect Opportunity Cost**, as well as **Social Opportunity Cost** and **Environmental Opportunity Cost**, highlighting the need for careful consideration of the specific trade-offs involved in each decision.",
