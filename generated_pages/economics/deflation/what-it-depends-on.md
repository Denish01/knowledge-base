# What Deflation Depends On

Money supply **monetary policy** is the most critical dependency for deflation, as it directly affects the amount of money circulating in an economy, with the European Central Bank's (ECB) tight monetary policy in 2011 exacerbating deflation in the Eurozone.

## Key Dependencies
- **Monetary policy** — effective management of money supply is required to prevent deflation, and without it, economies like Japan's in the 1990s can experience prolonged deflation, with the country's GDP growth averaging only 0.8% from 1992 to 2002 (World Bank data).
- **Consumer spending** — adequate consumer spending is necessary to drive demand and prevent deflation, and its absence, as seen in the US during the 2008 financial crisis, can lead to a decline in economic activity, with US consumer spending falling by 1.2% in 2009 (US Bureau of Economic Analysis).
- **Business investment** — sufficient business investment is needed to stimulate economic growth and prevent deflation, and without it, countries like Italy have experienced stagnant economic growth, with business investment in Italy decreasing by 2.5% in 2013 (OECD data).
- **Global trade** — a stable and open global trade environment is required to prevent deflation, and trade wars, such as the US-China trade war in 2018, can disrupt global supply chains and lead to deflationary pressures, with US imports from China decreasing by 12.5% in 2019 (US Census Bureau).
- **Financial stability** — a stable financial system is necessary to prevent deflation, and without it, economies like Iceland's in 2008 can experience financial crises, with Iceland's banking system collapsing and leading to a 6.5% decline in GDP (Icelandic Statistical Office).
- **Government fiscal policy** — effective government fiscal policy is needed to prevent deflation, and without it, countries like Greece have experienced severe economic contractions, with Greece's GDP declining by 7.1% in 2011 (Eurostat).

## Priority Order
The ranking of these dependencies from most to least critical is:
- **Monetary policy**, as it has the most direct impact on the money supply and can quickly respond to changes in the economy.
- **Consumer spending**, as it accounts for the largest portion of economic activity and has a significant impact on aggregate demand.
- **Business investment**, as it drives economic growth and innovation, but is more volatile and sensitive to changes in the economy.
- **Global trade**, as it affects the prices of goods and services, but its impact can be more gradual and dependent on various factors.
- **Financial stability**, as it provides the foundation for economic activity, but its impact may be more indirect and dependent on the effectiveness of other dependencies.
- **Government fiscal policy**, as it can have a significant impact on the economy, but its effects can be more delayed and dependent on various factors, such as the state of the economy and the effectiveness of other dependencies.

## Common Gaps
People often overlook the importance of **monetary policy** in preventing deflation, assuming that **fiscal policy** is the primary driver of economic activity, which can lead to inadequate monetary policy responses and exacerbate deflation, as seen in the Eurozone crisis where the ECB's initial response was criticized for being too slow and inadequate.
