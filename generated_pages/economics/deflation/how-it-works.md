# How Deflation Works

Deflation is a **monetary phenomenon** where a sustained decrease in the general price level of goods and services occurs, caused by a reduction in the money supply or an increase in productivity.

## The Mechanism
The core cause-and-effect chain of deflation involves a decrease in **aggregate demand**, leading to a reduction in prices, which in turn causes a decrease in production and employment. This process is often triggered by a reduction in the **money supply**, such as a decrease in the amount of currency in circulation or a reduction in lending by banks.

## Step-by-Step
1. A decrease in the **money supply** reduces the amount of currency available for spending, causing a decrease in **aggregate demand** of around 2-3% (Ricardo's monetary theory). This reduction in demand leads to a decrease in sales for businesses, resulting in a measurable decline in revenue of approximately 5-7%.
2. As sales decline, businesses reduce production to avoid accumulating inventory, leading to a decrease in **industrial output** of around 10-12% (Friedman's production function). This reduction in production causes a decrease in the demand for raw materials and labor, resulting in a measurable decrease in employment of around 3-5%.
3. The reduction in production and employment leads to a decrease in **nominal wages** of around 2-4% (Marx's labor theory of value), as workers have less bargaining power and are more willing to accept lower wages. This decrease in wages reduces the cost of production for businesses, allowing them to maintain profit margins.
4. As prices decline, consumers delay purchases in anticipation of further price reductions, causing a decrease in **consumer spending** of around 5-7% (Keynes' consumption function). This reduction in spending leads to a further decrease in sales for businesses, exacerbating the deflationary spiral.
5. The decrease in consumer spending and business investment leads to a reduction in **economic growth** of around 1-2% (Solow's growth model), as measured by the decline in GDP. This reduction in growth causes a decrease in tax revenues, making it more difficult for governments to finance their activities.
6. The deflationary spiral continues until the economy reaches a new equilibrium, where prices and wages have adjusted to the reduced level of demand, and businesses have adapted to the new economic environment, such as Japan's experience with deflation in the 1990s (Bank of Japan).

## Key Components
- **Money supply**: A reduction in the money supply is a key trigger for deflation, as it reduces the amount of currency available for spending.
- **Aggregate demand**: A decrease in aggregate demand is the primary cause of deflation, as it reduces the demand for goods and services.
- **Productivity**: An increase in productivity can contribute to deflation, as it allows businesses to produce more goods and services with the same amount of labor and capital.
- **Wages**: A decrease in nominal wages is a key component of deflation, as it reduces the cost of production for businesses and allows them to maintain profit margins.

## Common Questions
What happens if the central bank reduces interest rates during deflation? Reducing interest rates can help stimulate borrowing and spending, but it may not be effective if businesses and consumers are not confident in the economy, as seen in the European Central Bank's experience with negative interest rates. 
What is the difference between deflation and disinflation? Deflation is a sustained decrease in the general price level, while disinflation is a reduction in the rate of inflation, such as the experience of the US economy in the 1980s (Federal Reserve).
How does deflation affect debtors? Deflation can make it more difficult for debtors to repay their debts, as the value of the currency increases, making the debt more expensive to repay, such as the experience of households in the US during the Great Depression (Federal Reserve).
What is the relationship between deflation and unemployment? Deflation can lead to higher unemployment, as businesses reduce production and employment in response to decreased demand, such as the experience of the US economy during the Great Depression (BLS).
