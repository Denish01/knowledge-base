# Example of Central Bank

## Definition
Central bank is an institution that manages a nation's currency, monetary policy, and banking system, established by governments to regulate the money supply and maintain financial stability, with the first central bank, the **Sveriges Riksbank**, founded in 1668 by Johan Palmstruch.

## How It Works
A central bank operates by implementing monetary policies to control inflation, maintain low unemployment, and promote economic growth, using tools such as **interest rates** and **open market operations** to influence the money supply and credit conditions, with the Federal Reserve, the central bank of the United States, using its federal funds rate to guide the overall direction of monetary policy, as described by Milton Friedman's **monetary policy framework**. The central bank also supervises and regulates commercial banks to ensure their stability and soundness, with the **Basel Accords** providing a framework for international banking regulation, and requiring banks to maintain minimum capital requirements, such as a **Tier 1 capital** ratio of at least 6% (Basel Committee on Banking Supervision). Additionally, central banks manage a nation's foreign exchange reserves, with China's foreign exchange reserves totaling over $3 trillion (People's Bank of China), and may intervene in the foreign exchange market to influence the value of their currency.

The central bank's monetary policy decisions are typically made by a committee, such as the Federal Reserve's **Federal Open Market Committee**, which meets regularly to assess the state of the economy and set interest rates, with the European Central Bank's **Governing Council** following a similar process, and using economic indicators such as **GDP growth** and **inflation rates** to guide their decisions, with the Eurozone's inflation rate averaging around 1.5% (Eurostat). The central bank may also use **quantitative easing** to inject liquidity into the financial system, with the Bank of England's **Asset Purchase Facility** having purchased over £400 billion in government bonds (Bank of England), and may provide **lender of last resort** facilities to prevent the collapse of systemically important financial institutions, with the **Dodd-Frank Act** providing a framework for resolving failed banks in the United States.

The effectiveness of a central bank's policies can be measured using various economic indicators, such as the **Taylor rule**, which provides a guideline for setting interest rates based on inflation and output, with the rule suggesting that interest rates should be set at a level that is equal to the inflation rate plus a premium for economic growth, and the **Phillips curve**, which describes the relationship between inflation and unemployment, with the curve suggesting that lower unemployment is associated with higher inflation, as described by Alban William Phillips' **Phillips curve model**. Central banks may also use **macroprudential policy** to address systemic risks in the financial system, with the **Financial Stability Board** providing a framework for international cooperation on macroprudential policy, and may work with other regulatory agencies to implement **stress tests** and other measures to promote financial stability.

## Key Components
- **Monetary policy committee**: makes decisions on interest rates and other monetary policy tools, with the Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee meeting eight times per year to set interest rates.
- **Open market operations**: the central bank buys or sells government securities to influence the money supply and credit conditions, with the Federal Reserve having purchased over $2 trillion in government bonds since 2008 (Federal Reserve).
- **Reserve requirements**: commercial banks are required to hold a certain percentage of their deposits in reserve, with the Federal Reserve requiring banks to hold at least 10% of their deposits in reserve (Federal Reserve).
- **Lender of last resort**: the central bank provides emergency loans to prevent the collapse of systemically important financial institutions, with the Federal Reserve having provided over $1 trillion in emergency loans during the 2008 financial crisis (Federal Reserve).
- **Foreign exchange reserves**: the central bank manages a nation's foreign exchange reserves to influence the value of their currency, with China's foreign exchange reserves totaling over $3 trillion (People's Bank of China).
- **Bank supervision**: the central bank supervises and regulates commercial banks to ensure their stability and soundness, with the Federal Reserve conducting regular examinations of banks to assess their safety and soundness (Federal Reserve).

## Common Misconceptions
**Myth:** Central banks can simply print money to pay off a nation's debt — **Fact:** While central banks can create new money through monetary policy, this would lead to high inflation and devalue the currency, as described by Ricardo's **comparative advantage model**, 1817.
**Myth:** Central banks are independent and do not respond to political pressure — **Fact:** Central banks are often subject to political pressure and may be influenced by government policies, with the **Federal Reserve Transparency Act** providing a framework for congressional oversight of the Federal Reserve.
**Myth:** Central banks only care about inflation and do not consider other economic indicators — **Fact:** Central banks consider a range of economic indicators, including GDP growth, unemployment, and financial stability, as described by Keynes' **general theory of employment**, 1936.
**Myth:** Central banks can control the economy and prevent all economic downturns — **Fact:** Central banks have limited tools and cannot control all aspects of the economy, with the **Lucas critique** suggesting that monetary policy decisions are subject to uncertainty and unpredictability.

## In Practice
The European Central Bank (ECB) has implemented a range of monetary policy measures to address the eurozone's economic crisis, including cutting interest rates to zero and implementing a **quantitative easing** program, which has injected over €2 trillion into the financial system (European Central Bank), and has also provided **lender of last resort** facilities to several eurozone countries, including Greece and Ireland, with the ECB having provided over €100 billion in emergency loans to Greece (European Central Bank). The ECB has also worked with other regulatory agencies to implement **stress tests** and other measures to promote financial stability, with the **European Banking Authority** providing a framework for stress testing banks in the eurozone, and has used **macroprudential policy** to address systemic risks in the financial system, with the **Financial Stability Board** providing a framework for international cooperation on macroprudential policy.
