  "content": "## Definition\nA central bank is a national institution that manages a country's monetary policy, regulates its financial system, and maintains financial stability, with the first central bank established by **Sveriges Riksbank** in 1668.\n\n## How It Works\nCentral banks use monetary policy tools to control inflation, promote economic growth, and maintain financial stability. They achieve this through **open market operations**, where they buy or sell government securities to increase or decrease the money supply, thereby influencing interest rates and aggregate demand. For example, the **Federal Reserve** in the United States uses open market operations to implement its monetary policy decisions, with the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting eight times a year to set interest rates and discuss the direction of monetary policy.\n\nThe **money supply** is a critical component of a central bank's monetary policy, with the M2 money supply, which includes cash, checking deposits, and other liquid assets, totaling over $15 trillion in the United States (Federal Reserve). Central banks also regulate commercial banks and other financial institutions to ensure their stability and soundness, with the **Basel Accords** providing a framework for regulatory capital requirements. The Basel III accord, for instance, requires banks to maintain a minimum common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio of 4.5% (Bank for International Settlements).\n\nCentral banks also act as **lenders of last resort**, providing emergency loans to commercial banks during times of financial stress to prevent the collapse of the financial system. This was evident during the 2008 global financial crisis, when central banks around the world, including the Federal Reserve and the **European Central Bank**, implemented unconventional monetary policies, such as **quantitative easing**, to stabilize the financial system and stimulate economic growth. The Federal Reserve, for example, purchased over $2 trillion in mortgage-backed securities and Treasury bonds between 2008 and 2014 (Federal Reserve).\n\n## Key Components\n- **Reserve requirements**: The percentage of deposits that commercial banks must hold in reserve, rather than lending out, which affects the money supply and credit availability. An increase in reserve requirements reduces the money supply, while a decrease increases it.\n- **Discount rate**: The interest rate at which central banks lend to commercial banks, which influences the prime lending rate and overall interest rates in the economy. A decrease in the discount rate stimulates borrowing and spending, while an increase reduces it.\n- **Open market operations**: The buying or selling of government securities by central banks to increase or decrease the money supply and influence interest rates. An increase in open market operations increases the money supply, while a decrease reduces it.\n- **Monetary policy committee**: A committee that sets the central bank's monetary policy decisions, such as the Federal Reserve's FOMC. The committee's decisions affect the direction of monetary policy and the overall economy.\n- **Bank supervision**: The regulatory oversight of commercial banks and other financial institutions to ensure their stability and soundness. Effective bank supervision reduces the risk of bank failures and maintains financial stability.\n- **Foreign exchange reserves**: The holdings of foreign currencies by central banks, which can be used to influence exchange rates and maintain financial stability. A decrease in foreign exchange reserves can lead to a depreciation of the currency, while an increase can lead to an appreciation.\n\n## Common Misconceptions\n**Myth:** Central banks can simply print money to pay off a country's debt \u2014 **Fact:** Excessive money printing can lead to hyperinflation, as seen in **Zimbabwe** in the 2000s, where the inflation rate reached 89.7 sextillion percent (International Monetary Fund).\n**Myth:** Central banks are independent of government control \u2014 **Fact:** While central banks have operational independence, they are still accountable to the government and must work within a framework set by the government, as seen in the **Bank of England's** relationship with the UK Treasury.\n**Myth:** Central banks only focus on inflation control \u2014 **Fact:** Central banks also prioritize promoting economic growth, maintaining financial stability, and regulating the financial system, as outlined in the **Federal Reserve's** dual mandate.\n**Myth:** All central banks have the same powers and functions \u2014 **Fact:** Central banks have different powers and functions depending on the country and its economic system, such as the **People's Bank of China's** role in implementing the Chinese government's economic policies.\n\n## In Practice\nThe European Central Bank's (ECB) response to the **European sovereign-debt crisis** is a notable example of a central bank's role in maintaining financial stability. In 2012, the ECB launched the **Outright Monetary Transactions** (OMT) program, which allowed it to purchase government bonds from troubled eurozone countries, such as **Greece** and **Italy**, to reduce their borrowing costs and stabilize the financial system. The program helped to calm market fears and reduce the risk of a eurozone breakup, with the ECB purchasing over \u20ac2 trillion in government bonds between 2012 and 2018 (European Central Bank). The ECB's actions demonstrate the critical role that central banks play in maintaining financial stability and promoting economic growth, with the eurozone's GDP growth rate increasing from -0.4% in 2012 to 1.8% in 2018 (Eurostat).",
