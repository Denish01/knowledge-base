# How Central Bank Works

The central bank mechanism involves the **monetary policy** process, where the central bank uses tools such as **interest rates** and **open market operations** to control the **money supply** and achieve its objectives, including price stability and maximum employment.

## The Mechanism
The central bank mechanism is a complex process that involves the interaction of **monetary policy tools**, **financial markets**, and the **economy**. The core cause-and-effect chain is that the central bank sets **interest rates**, which affects the **cost of borrowing**, and in turn, influences **aggregate demand** and **inflation**.

## Step-by-Step
1. The central bank sets **interest rates**, which determines the **cost of borrowing** for commercial banks, with the federal funds rate, for example, being around 1.5% (Federal Reserve).
2. The commercial banks then use these **interest rates** to determine the **lending rates** for their customers, with the prime lending rate being around 4.5% (Bank of America).
3. The central bank also engages in **open market operations**, buying or selling government securities to increase or decrease the **money supply**, with the Federal Reserve holding around $4 trillion in Treasury securities (Federal Reserve).
4. The change in **money supply** affects the **exchange rate**, with a decrease in the money supply leading to an appreciation of the currency, such as the US dollar appreciating by around 10% against the euro (European Central Bank).
5. The **exchange rate** then affects **international trade**, with a stronger currency making exports more expensive, and imports cheaper, resulting in a trade deficit of around $500 billion (US Census Bureau).
6. The central bank monitors **inflation** and **employment** rates, using indicators such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the unemployment rate, which is around 4% (Bureau of Labor Statistics), to adjust its **monetary policy** tools.

## Key Components
- **Interest rates**: the central bank uses interest rates to control the cost of borrowing and influence aggregate demand, with higher interest rates reducing borrowing and spending.
- **Open market operations**: the central bank uses open market operations to increase or decrease the money supply, with the purchase of government securities increasing the money supply.
- **Reserve requirements**: the central bank sets reserve requirements for commercial banks, which determines the amount of funds that banks must hold in reserve, with a reserve requirement of around 10% (Federal Reserve).
- **Financial markets**: the central bank interacts with financial markets, such as the stock market and the bond market, to implement its monetary policy, with the stock market responding to changes in interest rates.

## Common Questions
What happens if the central bank lowers interest rates? Lowering interest rates reduces the cost of borrowing, increasing aggregate demand and economic growth, with the US economy growing by around 2.5% (Bureau of Economic Analysis) after a rate cut. 
What is the effect of open market operations on the money supply? Open market operations increase the money supply when the central bank buys government securities, and decrease it when it sells securities, with the money supply increasing by around $100 billion (Federal Reserve) after a purchase of Treasury securities.
How does the central bank control inflation? The central bank controls inflation by adjusting interest rates and the money supply, with higher interest rates reducing aggregate demand and inflation, and lower interest rates increasing aggregate demand and inflation, as described by **Milton Friedman's monetary theory**.
What is the role of the central bank in a financial crisis? The central bank acts as a **lender of last resort**, providing liquidity to the financial system and preventing a complete collapse of the economy, as seen during the 2008 financial crisis when the Federal Reserve provided around $1 trillion in emergency loans (Federal Reserve).
