  "content": "There are four main categories of central banks, organized by their primary function and structure: **Monetary Authority**, **Currency Board**, **Central Bank with Supervisory Powers**, and **Hybrid Central Bank**.\n\n## Main Categories\n- **Monetary Authority** \u2014 a central bank that has the sole responsibility of implementing monetary policy, with the primary goal of maintaining price stability, as seen in the European Central Bank, which has maintained an inflation rate below 2% (European Central Bank annual report).\n- **Currency Board** \u2014 a central bank that issues currency backed by foreign exchange reserves, with the primary goal of maintaining a fixed exchange rate, as seen in the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, which has maintained a fixed exchange rate with the US dollar since 1983.\n- **Central Bank with Supervisory Powers** \u2014 a central bank that has the additional responsibility of supervising and regulating the banking system, with the primary goal of maintaining financial stability, as seen in the Bank of England, which has been responsible for regulating the UK banking system since 2013 (Bank of England annual report).\n- **Hybrid Central Bank** \u2014 a central bank that combines elements of monetary authority, currency board, and supervisory powers, with the primary goal of achieving a balance between price stability, exchange rate stability, and financial stability, as seen in the Reserve Bank of Australia, which has a dual mandate to maintain price stability and full employment (Reserve Bank of Australia annual report).\n\n## Comparison Table\n| Category | Primary Goal | Instrument | Risk |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Monetary Authority** | Price stability | Interest rates | Low |\n| **Currency Board** | Exchange rate stability | Foreign exchange reserves | High |\n| **Central Bank with Supervisory Powers** | Financial stability | Regulation | Medium |\n| **Hybrid Central Bank** | Balanced stability | Multiple instruments | Medium |\n\n## How They Relate\nThe categories of central banks are not mutually exclusive, and many central banks have elements of multiple categories. For example, the Federal Reserve in the United States has elements of both **Monetary Authority** and **Central Bank with Supervisory Powers**, as it has the dual mandate of maintaining price stability and maximum employment, while also supervising and regulating the US banking system (Federal Reserve annual report). Similarly, the People's Bank of China has elements of both **Currency Board** and **Hybrid Central Bank**, as it has a managed exchange rate system and also uses monetary policy instruments to achieve price stability and financial stability (People's Bank of China annual report). The **Monetary Authority** and **Currency Board** categories are often confused, as both involve the management of monetary policy, but the key difference lies in the primary goal and instrument used. In contrast, the **Central Bank with Supervisory Powers** and **Hybrid Central Bank** categories are often overlapping, as many central banks have both supervisory and monetary policy responsibilities.",
