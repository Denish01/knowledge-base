# Central Bank Compared

## Definition
Central Bank Compared refers to a comprehensive analysis of the monetary policy frameworks, tools, and outcomes of central banks worldwide, with the term originating from the work of economist **Milton Friedman** in the 1960s.

## How It Works
Central banks employ a range of mechanisms to achieve their dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment, with the **Federal Reserve** in the United States using the federal funds rate to influence short-term interest rates, which in turn affects borrowing costs and economic activity. The European Central Bank, for instance, has implemented a negative interest rate policy to stimulate economic growth, resulting in a deposit facility rate of -0.5% (European Central Bank). Furthermore, central banks also utilize macroprudential policies, such as countercyclical capital buffers, to mitigate systemic risk and maintain financial stability, as seen in the implementation of the **Basel III** framework by the Bank for International Settlements.

The effectiveness of central bank policies can be measured by examining key economic indicators, such as inflation rates, unemployment rates, and GDP growth rates. For example, the **Bank of Japan** has implemented an inflation targeting framework, aiming to achieve an inflation rate of 2%, and has maintained a negative interest rate policy to support economic growth, resulting in an average annual GDP growth rate of 1.2% from 2013 to 2020 (World Bank data). Additionally, central banks also engage in foreign exchange market interventions to influence exchange rates and maintain competitiveness, as seen in the actions of the **Swiss National Bank**, which has intervened in the foreign exchange market to weaken the Swiss franc and support exports.

Central banks also collaborate with other financial institutions and governments to achieve their objectives, with the **International Monetary Fund** providing technical assistance and policy advice to central banks in developing countries. The **Bank of England**, for instance, has established a framework for resolving failing banks, which includes the use of bail-in instruments to absorb losses and maintain financial stability. Moreover, central banks also face challenges in communicating their policies and actions to the public, with the **Federal Reserve** using forward guidance to shape market expectations and influence long-term interest rates.

## Key Components
- **Monetary policy framework**: defines the objectives, instruments, and procedures of a central bank's monetary policy, and changes in this framework can significantly impact the overall direction of monetary policy, such as the shift from a single mandate to a dual mandate.
- **Interest rates**: are a key tool used by central banks to influence borrowing costs and economic activity, and changes in interest rates can have significant effects on inflation, employment, and economic growth, with a 1% increase in interest rates reducing borrowing and spending.
- **Macroprudential policies**: aim to mitigate systemic risk and maintain financial stability, and changes in these policies can impact the resilience of the financial system, such as the introduction of countercyclical capital buffers to reduce the risk of bank failures.
- **Foreign exchange market interventions**: can influence exchange rates and maintain competitiveness, and changes in these interventions can impact trade balances and economic growth, with a 10% depreciation of the exchange rate increasing exports by 5%.
- **Forward guidance**: is used by central banks to shape market expectations and influence long-term interest rates, and changes in forward guidance can impact market confidence and economic activity, with a clear and consistent communication of policy intentions reducing uncertainty and increasing investment.
- **Financial stability framework**: defines the procedures and instruments used by central banks to maintain financial stability, and changes in this framework can impact the resilience of the financial system, such as the introduction of stress testing to identify potential vulnerabilities.

## Common Misconceptions
**Myth:** Central banks can control inflation by simply printing more money — **Fact:** Excessive money printing can lead to hyperinflation, as seen in **Zimbabwe** in the 2000s, where the annual inflation rate reached 89.7 sextillion percent (Hanke and Kwok).
**Myth:** Central banks are independent and do not respond to political pressure — **Fact:** Central banks are often subject to political influence, as seen in the case of the **Turkish Central Bank**, which has faced pressure from the government to cut interest rates (Reuters).
**Myth:** Central banks can solve economic crises by simply cutting interest rates — **Fact:** Interest rate cuts may not be effective in resolving economic crises, as seen in the case of **Japan**, where low interest rates have failed to stimulate economic growth (Krugman).
**Myth:** Central banks can maintain financial stability by simply regulating banks — **Fact:** Central banks must also regulate non-bank financial institutions, such as **shadow banks**, to maintain financial stability, as seen in the case of the **2008 financial crisis**, where the failure of non-bank financial institutions contributed to the crisis (Financial Stability Board).

## In Practice
The **European Central Bank** has implemented a quantitative easing program, purchasing €2.6 trillion in government bonds and other assets to stimulate economic growth and maintain price stability, resulting in a decline in the euro-area unemployment rate from 12.1% in 2013 to 7.3% in 2020 (European Central Bank data). The **Federal Reserve** has also implemented a similar program, purchasing $3.5 trillion in mortgage-backed securities and Treasury bonds to support the housing market and stimulate economic growth, resulting in a decline in the US unemployment rate from 10% in 2009 to 3.5% in 2020 (Federal Reserve data). Additionally, the **Bank of England** has implemented a funding for lending scheme, providing £80 billion in cheap loans to banks to support lending to small and medium-sized enterprises, resulting in a 10% increase in lending to these businesses (Bank of England data).
