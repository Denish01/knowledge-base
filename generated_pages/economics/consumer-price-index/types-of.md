# Types of Consumer Price Index

There are four main categories of Consumer Price Index (CPI), organized by their scope and methodology: **Headline CPI**, **Core CPI**, **Food CPI**, and **Shelter CPI**. 
## Main Categories
- **Headline CPI** — measures the total change in prices of a basket of goods and services consumed by households, including volatile items like food and energy, as seen in the **US Bureau of Labor Statistics'** (BLS) CPI for All Urban Consumers, which includes data on the prices of over 80,000 items.
- **Core CPI** — excludes prices of food and energy to better capture the underlying inflation trend, as calculated by the **European Central Bank**, which uses a Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) excluding energy and food.
- **Food CPI** — tracks the change in prices of food items only, such as the **USDA's** Food Price Index, which monitors the prices of over 200 food items, including beef, poultry, and dairy products, with **Tyson Foods** being a major player in the US meat market, producing ~25% of the country's beef (National Cattlemen's Beef Association).
- **Shelter CPI** — focuses on the prices of housing-related items, such as rent, utilities, and furniture, as seen in the **Canadian CPI's** shelter component, which accounts for approximately 27% of the overall CPI basket, with **CMHC** (Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation) providing data on Canadian housing market trends.

## Comparison Table
| Category | Scope | Methodology | Frequency |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Headline CPI | Total consumption | Fixed basket | Monthly |
| Core CPI | Non-volatile consumption | Exclusion of food and energy | Monthly |
| Food CPI | Food items only | Variable basket | Monthly |
| Shelter CPI | Housing-related items | Fixed basket | Monthly |

## How They Relate
The categories overlap and feed into each other, as **Headline CPI** includes **Food CPI** and **Shelter CPI**, while **Core CPI** excludes **Food CPI**. Specifically, **Headline CPI** and **Core CPI** are often confused, but the latter provides a clearer picture of underlying inflation by excluding volatile items. The **Food CPI** and **Shelter CPI** are commonly used to analyze specific sectors of the economy, such as the impact of droughts on food prices or the effect of housing market trends on **Shelter CPI**, with **Freddie Mac** providing data on US housing market trends. Additionally, the **US Bureau of Labor Statistics** (BLS) calculates both **Headline CPI** and **Core CPI**, while the **International Monetary Fund** (IMF) uses **Core CPI** to monitor inflation trends in member countries, with **Ricardo's comparative advantage model** providing a framework for understanding international trade and its impact on prices.
