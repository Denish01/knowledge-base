  "content": "## Definition\nConsumer Price Index (CPI) is a statistical measure that tracks changes in the prices of a basket of goods and services consumed by households, developed by Laspeyres in 1871.\n\n## How It Works\nThe CPI is calculated by collecting data on the prices of a representative sample of goods and services, known as the **market basket**, which includes items such as food, housing, apparel, and entertainment. The prices of these items are then weighted according to their relative importance in the average household budget, using a methodology similar to **Ricardo's comparative advantage model**. For example, the CPI in the United States is calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), which collects price data from approximately 23,000 retail establishments across the country, representing about 80,000 individual items (BLS).\n\nThe CPI is used to measure **inflation**, which is the rate of change in prices over a given period. A high CPI indicates that prices are rising, while a low CPI indicates that prices are stable or falling. The CPI is also used to adjust **wages** and **benefits** to keep pace with inflation, ensuring that the purchasing power of households is maintained. According to the **Fisher equation**, which relates inflation to money supply and velocity, a 1% increase in the CPI can lead to a 1% increase in wages and benefits, assuming a constant **money supply** (Fisher, 1896).\n\nThe CPI is not a perfect measure, as it has several limitations, including **substitution bias**, which occurs when consumers switch to cheaper alternatives in response to price changes. For example, if the price of beef increases, consumers may switch to chicken, which can lead to an underestimation of inflation. To address this issue, some countries use alternative measures, such as the **chained CPI**, which takes into account changes in consumer behavior (BLS).\n\n## Key Components\n- **Weighting**: The process of assigning relative importance to each item in the market basket, based on its share of household expenditure. An increase in the weight of a particular item can lead to a higher CPI, if its price is rising.\n- **Sampling**: The process of selecting a representative sample of goods and services to include in the market basket. A larger sample size can lead to a more accurate CPI, but it also increases the cost of data collection.\n- **Price collection**: The process of collecting price data from retail establishments. The frequency of price collection can affect the accuracy of the CPI, with more frequent collection leading to a more timely measure of inflation.\n- **Index calculation**: The process of calculating the CPI from the collected price data. The choice of index formula, such as the **Laspeyres index** or the **Paasche index**, can affect the resulting CPI.\n- **Seasonal adjustment**: The process of removing seasonal fluctuations from the CPI, to obtain a more stable measure of inflation. The use of seasonal adjustment can lead to a more accurate estimate of the underlying inflation trend.\n- **Revision**: The process of revising the CPI to reflect changes in the market basket or in the methodology used to calculate the index. A revision can lead to changes in the CPI, even if prices have not changed.\n\n## Common Misconceptions\n**Myth:** The CPI is a perfect measure of inflation \u2014 **Fact:** The CPI has several limitations, including substitution bias and **quality adjustment bias**, which can lead to an underestimation or overestimation of inflation (BLS).\n**Myth:** The CPI only measures price changes \u2014 **Fact:** The CPI also measures changes in the quality of goods and services, through the use of **hedonic adjustment**, which can lead to a more accurate estimate of inflation (Triplett, 2004).\n**Myth:** The CPI is only used to measure inflation \u2014 **Fact:** The CPI is also used to adjust wages and benefits, and to calculate the **GDP deflator**, which is a measure of the overall price level of the economy (BEA).\n**Myth:** The CPI is calculated in the same way in all countries \u2014 **Fact:** The methodology used to calculate the CPI can vary across countries, with some countries using a **chain-weighted index** and others using a **fixed-weight index** (IMF).\n\n## In Practice\nIn the United States, the CPI is used to adjust the **Social Security benefits** to keep pace with inflation, ensuring that the purchasing power of beneficiaries is maintained. For example, in 2020, the CPI increased by 1.4%, leading to a 1.4% increase in Social Security benefits, which affected approximately 64 million beneficiaries (SSA). The CPI is also used by the **Federal Reserve** to set **monetary policy**, with a target inflation rate of 2% (Federal Reserve). In Japan, the CPI is used to adjust the **pension benefits**, with a 1% increase in the CPI leading to a 1% increase in pension benefits, affecting approximately 30 million beneficiaries (Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare).",
