# How Consumer Price Index Works

The **Consumer Price Index (CPI)** is a statistical measure that tracks the average change in prices of a basket of goods and services consumed by households, calculated by collecting data on the prices of around 80,000 items (Bureau of Labor Statistics).

## The Mechanism
The CPI mechanism involves collecting price data on a representative sample of goods and services, weighting these prices by their relative importance in the average household budget, and then calculating the percentage change in the overall price level. This process produces a **price index**, which is used to measure **inflation**, with the CPI being the most widely used indicator of inflation in many countries, including the United States, where the Bureau of Labor Statistics calculates the CPI monthly.

## Step-by-Step
1. The first step in calculating the CPI is to select a **basket of goods and services**, which includes around 80,000 items such as food, housing, apparel, and transportation, with the weights of these items based on their relative importance in the average household budget, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics' **Consumer Expenditure Survey**, which shows that housing accounts for around 42% of the average household budget.
2. The next step is to collect **price data** on these items from a sample of retailers, service providers, and other sources, with prices collected for around 6,000 items each month, and the prices of these items are then weighted by their relative importance in the basket, using weights such as 0.42 for housing, to calculate the **weighted average price**.
3. The **price index** is then calculated by comparing the weighted average price of the basket in the current period to the weighted average price in the **base period**, which is usually a previous year or quarter, with the result expressed as a percentage change, such as a 2% increase in the CPI over the past 12 months.
4. The fourth step is to **seasonally adjust** the CPI data to account for regular fluctuations in prices that occur at the same time every year, such as higher prices for winter clothing in January, with the seasonally adjusted CPI showing a 1.5% increase over the past 12 months, compared to a 2% increase in the unadjusted CPI.
5. The final step is to **publish** the CPI data, which is usually released on a monthly basis, and is used by policymakers, businesses, and individuals to make informed decisions about monetary policy, investment, and purchasing power, with the Federal Reserve using the CPI to set **monetary policy**, aiming to keep inflation at around 2% annual rate.
6. The CPI data is also used to **adjust** social security benefits, pensions, and other payments to keep pace with inflation, with the Social Security Administration using the CPI to calculate the **cost-of-living adjustment**, which is around 1.6% for 2022, based on the CPI increase over the past 12 months.

## Key Components
- **Basket of goods and services**: the selection of items included in the CPI calculation, which determines the relative importance of different categories of spending in the average household budget.
- **Price data collection**: the process of gathering prices for the items in the basket, which requires a large sample of retailers and service providers to ensure accurate and representative data.
- **Weighting**: the process of assigning relative importance to each item in the basket, based on its share of the average household budget, which is critical to ensuring that the CPI accurately reflects the average household's experience of inflation.
- **Base period**: the reference period used to calculate the price index, which is usually a previous year or quarter, and provides a benchmark for measuring changes in prices over time.

## Common Questions
What happens if the basket of goods and services becomes outdated? The CPI will no longer accurately reflect the average household's experience of inflation, as the weights assigned to different categories of spending will no longer be representative, for example, if the basket does not include newer items such as smartphones, which account for around 1% of the average household budget.
How is the CPI used in monetary policy? The Federal Reserve uses the CPI to set monetary policy, aiming to keep inflation at around 2% annual rate, by adjusting interest rates and the money supply to influence the overall level of economic activity and keep prices stable.
What is the difference between the CPI and other measures of inflation, such as the **GDP deflator**? The CPI measures the average change in prices of a basket of goods and services consumed by households, while the GDP deflator measures the average change in prices of all goods and services produced within a country, with the CPI being more narrowly focused on household spending.
How does the CPI account for changes in the quality of goods and services over time? The CPI uses **hedonic adjustment** to account for changes in the quality of goods and services, such as improvements in technology or design, which can affect the price of an item without changing its overall value to the consumer, for example, a new smartphone may be more expensive than an older model, but it also has more features and better performance.
