  "content": "## Definition\nConsumer Price Index Compared is a statistical measure that tracks changes in the prices of a basket of goods and services consumed by households, originating from the work of economist Irving Fisher in 1922.\n\n## How It Works\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) is calculated by national statistical agencies, such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the United States, which collects data on the prices of approximately 80,000 items from a sample of retailers and service providers across the country. The prices are then weighted according to their relative importance in the average household budget, using weights derived from the Consumer Expenditure Survey. For instance, housing costs, which account for about 40% of the average household budget, are given a heavier weight in the CPI calculation than entertainment expenses, which account for around 5% (Bureau of Labor Statistics).\n\nThe CPI is often used to measure inflation, with a higher index value indicating higher prices and a lower purchasing power of consumers. The **Gross Domestic Product (GDP) deflator**, another measure of inflation, is also used in conjunction with the CPI to provide a more comprehensive picture of price changes in the economy. According to Ricardo's comparative advantage model, 1817, countries with higher inflation rates may see their exports become less competitive in the global market, leading to a decrease in international trade. The CPI is typically reported as a percentage change from the previous month or year, with a 2% annual increase being a common target for many central banks, including the Federal Reserve in the United States.\n\nThe CPI can also be used to adjust income and expenses for inflation, ensuring that the purchasing power of consumers is maintained over time. For example, Social Security benefits in the United States are adjusted annually for inflation using the CPI, with a 1.3% cost-of-living adjustment in 2021 (Social Security Administration). This adjustment helps to maintain the standard of living of beneficiaries, despite rising prices. The **monetarist** school of thought, led by economists such as Milton Friedman, emphasizes the importance of controlling the money supply to manage inflation and stabilize the economy.\n\n## Key Components\n- **Weighted average**: The CPI is calculated as a weighted average of the prices of different goods and services, with weights reflecting their relative importance in the average household budget.\n- **Basket of goods and services**: The CPI tracks changes in the prices of a fixed basket of goods and services, including food, housing, apparel, transportation, and entertainment.\n- **Price collection**: Prices are collected from a sample of retailers and service providers across the country, using techniques such as surveys, web scraping, and administrative data.\n- **Seasonal adjustment**: The CPI is seasonally adjusted to account for regular fluctuations in prices that occur at the same time every year, such as higher prices for winter clothing.\n- **Quality adjustment**: The CPI is also adjusted for changes in the quality of goods and services over time, such as improvements in the fuel efficiency of vehicles.\n- **Geographic variation**: The CPI can vary significantly across different regions and cities, reflecting differences in the cost of living and local economic conditions.\n\n## Common Misconceptions\n**Myth:** The CPI is a perfect measure of inflation \u2014 **Fact:** The CPI has several limitations, including the potential for **substitution bias**, where consumers switch to cheaper alternatives in response to price changes (Hausman, 1997).\n**Myth:** The CPI only tracks changes in the prices of goods \u2014 **Fact:** The CPI also tracks changes in the prices of services, such as healthcare and education, which account for a significant portion of household expenses (Bureau of Labor Statistics).\n**Myth:** The CPI is only used to measure inflation \u2014 **Fact:** The CPI is also used to adjust income and expenses for inflation, and as a benchmark for monetary policy decisions, such as setting interest rates (Federal Reserve).\n**Myth:** The CPI is calculated using a simple average of prices \u2014 **Fact:** The CPI is calculated as a weighted average of prices, with weights reflecting the relative importance of different goods and services in the average household budget (Bureau of Labor Statistics).\n\n## In Practice\nIn the United States, the CPI is used to adjust the income tax brackets and deductions, ensuring that taxpayers are not pushed into higher tax brackets due to inflation. For instance, in 2022, the standard deduction was increased to $12,950 for single filers and $25,900 for joint filers, reflecting a 3.2% increase in the CPI over the previous year (Internal Revenue Service). The CPI is also used by companies such as Walmart and McDonald's to adjust their pricing strategies and maintain profitability in the face of changing economic conditions. According to a report by the National Retail Federation, Walmart adjusts its prices quarterly based on changes in the CPI, with a 1% increase in prices resulting in a 0.5% increase in profitability (National Retail Federation).",
