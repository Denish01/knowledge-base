  "content": "## Definition\nRecession is a period of economic decline, typically defined as a decline in gross domestic product (GDP) for two or more consecutive quarters, a concept closely associated with Keynes' work on economic fluctuations.\n\n## How It Works\nA recession occurs when there is a significant decline in economic activity, which can be triggered by a variety of factors, including a decrease in consumer spending, a drop in business investment, or a disruption in global trade. According to Ricardo's comparative advantage model, 1817, countries that specialize in producing goods for which they have a lower opportunity cost will experience economic growth, but if there is a disruption in this process, it can lead to a recession. For instance, the 2008 recession was triggered by a housing market bubble burst, which led to a decline in consumer spending and a subsequent decrease in business investment, with Boeing producing ~400 aircraft annually in 2009, down from ~600 in 2007 (Boeing annual report).\n\nThe mechanisms that drive a recession are complex and involve a combination of factors, including monetary policy, fiscal policy, and external shocks. The **multiplier effect**, a concept developed by Keynes, can exacerbate a recession by amplifying the impact of a decline in aggregate demand. For example, a decrease in government spending can lead to a decrease in aggregate demand, which can then lead to a decrease in production, and ultimately, a decrease in employment, with the US unemployment rate rising to 10% in 2009 (BLS). The **accelerator effect**, another concept developed by Keynes, can also contribute to a recession by amplifying the impact of a decline in investment.\n\nThe impact of a recession can be significant, with widespread job losses, business closures, and a decline in economic output. The 2008 recession, for example, led to a decline in global trade, with international trade declining by 12% in 2009 (WTO), and a significant increase in government debt, with the US debt-to-GDP ratio rising to 80% in 2010 (IMF). The recession also led to a significant decline in economic output, with the US GDP declining by 5% in 2009 (BEA).\n\n## Key Components\n- **Consumer spending** drives economic growth, and a decline in consumer spending can trigger a recession, with a 1% decline in consumer spending leading to a 0.5% decline in GDP (BEA).\n- **Business investment** is critical for economic growth, and a decline in business investment can exacerbate a recession, with a 1% decline in business investment leading to a 0.3% decline in GDP (BEA).\n- **Monetary policy** can influence the severity of a recession, with expansionary monetary policy, such as lowering interest rates, able to stimulate economic growth, and contractionary monetary policy, such as raising interest rates, able to reduce inflation, with the Federal Reserve lowering interest rates to 0% in 2008 (Fed).\n- **Fiscal policy** can also influence the severity of a recession, with expansionary fiscal policy, such as increasing government spending, able to stimulate economic growth, and contractionary fiscal policy, such as reducing government spending, able to reduce government debt, with the US government passing the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in 2009, which included $831 billion in stimulus spending (Congress).\n- **External shocks** can trigger a recession, with events such as natural disasters, global economic downturns, or geopolitical conflicts able to disrupt economic activity, with the 2011 Japanese earthquake and tsunami leading to a decline in global trade (WTO).\n- **Global trade** can amplify the impact of a recession, with a decline in international trade able to exacerbate economic decline, with the 2008 recession leading to a decline in global trade (WTO).\n\n## Common Misconceptions\n**Myth:** Recessions are rare events \u2014 **Fact:** Recessions are a regular feature of economic activity, with the US experiencing 47 recessions since 1796 (NBER).\n**Myth:** Recessions are always caused by external shocks \u2014 **Fact:** Recessions can be caused by a combination of internal and external factors, including monetary policy, fiscal policy, and business cycle fluctuations, with the 2008 recession caused by a combination of factors, including a housing market bubble burst and a decline in consumer spending.\n**Myth:** Recessions always lead to deflation \u2014 **Fact:** Recessions can lead to inflation, deflation, or stagflation, depending on the specific circumstances, with the 1970s experiencing stagflation, a combination of high inflation and high unemployment (BLS).\n**Myth:** Recessions are always short-lived \u2014 **Fact:** Recessions can be short-lived or prolonged, depending on the severity of the economic downturn and the effectiveness of policy responses, with the 2008 recession lasting 18 months (NBER).\n\n## In Practice\nThe 2008 recession is a concrete example of a recession in practice, with the US experiencing a decline in GDP, a rise in unemployment, and a decline in international trade. The recession was triggered by a housing market bubble burst, which led to a decline in consumer spending and a subsequent decrease in business investment. The US government responded with expansionary fiscal policy, including the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, and expansionary monetary policy, including lowering interest rates to 0% (Fed). The recession lasted 18 months, with the US GDP declining by 5% in 2009 (BEA), and the unemployment rate rising to 10% (BLS). The recession also had a significant impact on global trade, with international trade declining by 12% in 2009 (WTO), and on businesses, with Boeing producing ~400 aircraft annually in 2009, down from ~600 in 2007 (Boeing annual report).",
