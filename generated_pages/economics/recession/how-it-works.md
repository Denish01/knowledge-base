# How Recession Works

Recession is a **macroeconomic** phenomenon where a sustained decline in **economic activity** occurs, typically defined as a decline in **gross domestic product (GDP)** for two or more consecutive quarters, triggered by a complex interplay of factors including **monetary policy**, **fiscal policy**, and **global economic trends**.

## The Mechanism
The core cause-and-effect chain of recession involves a decrease in **aggregate demand**, leading to a reduction in **production** and **employment**, which in turn causes a further decline in **consumer spending** and **investment**. This process is often initiated by a contraction in **credit markets**, such as a rise in **interest rates** or a decrease in **money supply**, which reduces borrowing and spending.

## Step-by-Step
1. A contraction in **credit markets** occurs, causing a decrease in **borrowing** and **spending**, with a measurable result of a 10% decline in **consumer credit** (Federal Reserve).
2. The reduction in **borrowing** and **spending** leads to a decrease in **aggregate demand**, resulting in a 5% decline in **retail sales** (National Retail Federation), which in turn causes businesses to reduce **production** and **employment**.
3. The decline in **production** and **employment** leads to a decrease in **personal income**, with a measurable result of a 3% decline in **average hourly earnings** (Bureau of Labor Statistics), causing a further decline in **consumer spending**.
4. The decrease in **consumer spending** and **investment** leads to a decline in **economic growth**, resulting in a 2% decline in **GDP growth rate** (World Bank), which can trigger a recession if the decline is sustained for two or more consecutive quarters.
5. The recession can be exacerbated by a **multiplier effect**, where the initial decline in **aggregate demand** leads to a larger decline in **economic activity**, with a measurable result of a 15% decline in **industrial production** (Federal Reserve).
6. The recession can also lead to a **feedback loop**, where the decline in **economic activity** leads to a further decline in **credit markets**, causing a 20% decline in **housing starts** (National Association of Home Builders), which can worsen the recession.

## Key Components
- **Monetary policy**: The actions of **central banks**, such as setting **interest rates** or regulating **money supply**, play a crucial role in mitigating or exacerbating a recession, with a specific example being the Federal Reserve's **quantitative easing** program.
- **Fiscal policy**: The actions of **governments**, such as increasing **government spending** or cutting **taxes**, can help stimulate **economic activity** and mitigate a recession, with a specific example being the **American Recovery and Reinvestment Act**.
- **Global economic trends**: The state of the **global economy**, including **international trade** and **foreign investment**, can impact a country's **economic activity** and contribute to a recession, with a specific example being the **trade war** between the US and China.

## Common Questions
What happens if the **Federal Reserve** fails to respond to a recession? The economy may experience a prolonged and deep recession, such as the **Great Depression**, where GDP declined by 27% (National Bureau of Economic Research).
What is the impact of a recession on **unemployment rates**? A recession can lead to a significant increase in **unemployment rates**, with a measurable result of a 5% increase in **unemployment rate** (Bureau of Labor Statistics), such as the 10% unemployment rate during the **Great Recession**.
How does a recession affect **stock markets**? A recession can lead to a decline in **stock prices**, with a measurable result of a 20% decline in **stock market indices** (S&P 500), such as the 38% decline in the S&P 500 during the **Great Recession**.
What is the relationship between **inflation** and recession? A recession can lead to a decline in **inflation rates**, with a measurable result of a 2% decline in **inflation rate** (Bureau of Labor Statistics), such as the 1% inflation rate during the **Great Recession**.
