# What Recession Depends On

Consumer spending is the most critical dependency for a recession, as a decline in **Aggregate Demand** can lead to reduced production, job losses, and economic downturn, as seen in the 2008 recession where a sharp decline in consumer spending contributed to a 5.1% decline in GDP (Bureau of Economic Analysis).

## Key Dependencies
- **Financial Stability** — a stable financial system is required to facilitate borrowing and lending, and its absence can lead to a credit crisis, as witnessed in the 2008 recession where the collapse of Lehman Brothers led to a freeze in credit markets, causing a significant decline in economic activity.
- **Investment** — investment in capital goods and infrastructure is necessary to drive economic growth, and a decline in investment can lead to reduced productivity and economic stagnation, as seen in Japan's lost decade of the 1990s where low investment led to stagnant economic growth.
- **Government Policy** — effective government policy is necessary to regulate the economy and respond to economic shocks, and its absence can lead to exacerbated economic downturns, as seen in the 1930s where inadequate government policy worsened the Great Depression.
- **Global Trade** — global trade is necessary to facilitate the exchange of goods and services, and a decline in trade can lead to reduced economic activity, as seen in the 2019 US-China trade war where tariffs and trade restrictions led to a decline in trade and economic growth.
- **Monetary Policy** — effective monetary policy is necessary to regulate the money supply and interest rates, and its absence can lead to inflation or deflation, as seen in the 1970s where high inflation led to a decline in the purchasing power of consumers.
- **Labor Market** — a stable labor market is necessary to facilitate employment and income growth, and its absence can lead to reduced consumer spending and economic activity, as seen in the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic where widespread job losses led to a significant decline in economic activity.

## Priority Order
The priority order of these dependencies is:
- **Financial Stability**, as a stable financial system is necessary to facilitate borrowing and lending, and its absence can lead to a credit crisis, as seen in the 2008 recession.
- **Consumer Spending**, as a decline in aggregate demand can lead to reduced production, job losses, and economic downturn.
- **Government Policy**, as effective government policy is necessary to regulate the economy and respond to economic shocks.
- **Investment**, as investment in capital goods and infrastructure is necessary to drive economic growth.
- **Global Trade**, as global trade is necessary to facilitate the exchange of goods and services.
- **Monetary Policy**, as effective monetary policy is necessary to regulate the money supply and interest rates, but its impact is more indirect compared to the other dependencies.

## Common Gaps
People often overlook the importance of **Financial Stability** and **Labor Market** stability, assuming that these will always be present, but the absence of these can lead to significant economic downturns, as seen in the 2008 recession and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, respectively. Another common gap is the assumption that **Government Policy** will always be effective, but inadequate policy can worsen economic downturns, as seen in the 1930s.
