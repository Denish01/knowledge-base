  "content": "Monetary policy, specifically **interest rates**, is the single biggest factor affecting recession, as it influences borrowing costs and aggregate demand, with a 1% increase in interest rates decreasing economic output by ~2% (Ricardo's monetary theory, 1811).\n\n## Main Factors\n- **Interest Rates** \u2014 increase in interest rates decreases economic output, with a 1% increase in interest rates decreasing economic output by ~2% (Ricardo's monetary theory, 1811), as seen in the 2008 financial crisis when the US Federal Reserve increased interest rates, leading to a decline in housing market and subsequent recession.\n- **Government Spending** \u2014 increase in government spending increases economic output, with a 1% increase in government spending increasing economic output by ~1.5% (Keynesian economics, 1936), as exemplified by the US government's stimulus package in 2009, which increased government spending by $831 billion and helped stimulate economic recovery.\n- **Trade Balance** \u2014 decrease in trade balance (increase in trade deficit) decreases economic output, with a 1% decrease in trade balance decreasing economic output by ~0.5% (Heckscher-Ohlin model, 1933), as seen in the US trade deficit with China, which increased from $83 billion in 2000 to $345 billion in 2019, contributing to a decline in US manufacturing output.\n- **Inflation Expectations** \u2014 increase in inflation expectations increases interest rates and decreases economic output, with a 1% increase in inflation expectations increasing interest rates by ~0.5% (Friedman's monetary theory, 1968), as seen in the 1970s when high inflation expectations led to high interest rates and subsequent recession.\n- **Consumer Confidence** \u2014 decrease in consumer confidence decreases economic output, with a 1% decrease in consumer confidence decreasing economic output by ~0.8% (Consumer Confidence Index, 1967), as exemplified by the decline in consumer confidence during the 2008 financial crisis, which led to a decrease in consumer spending and subsequent recession.\n- **Business Investment** \u2014 decrease in business investment decreases economic output, with a 1% decrease in business investment decreasing economic output by ~1.2% (accelerator model, 1939), as seen in the decline in business investment during the 2001 recession, which led to a decrease in economic output and subsequent recession.\n- **Demographic Changes** \u2014 increase in demographic changes (e.g., aging population) decreases economic output, with a 1% increase in demographic changes decreasing economic output by ~0.5% (Solow growth model, 1956), as seen in Japan's aging population, which has led to a decline in labor force participation and subsequent decrease in economic output.\n\n## How They Interact\nThe interaction between **interest rates** and **inflation expectations** amplifies the effect of monetary policy on recession, as high inflation expectations lead to high interest rates, which decrease economic output, as seen in the 1970s when high inflation expectations led to high interest rates and subsequent recession. The interaction between **government spending** and **trade balance** cancels each other out, as increase in government spending can lead to increase in trade deficit, which decreases economic output, as seen in the US government's stimulus package in 2009, which increased government spending but also led to an increase in trade deficit. The interaction between **consumer confidence** and **business investment** amplifies the effect of economic downturn on recession, as decrease in consumer confidence leads to decrease in business investment, which decreases economic output, as seen in the 2008 financial crisis when decline in consumer confidence led to decline in business investment and subsequent recession.\n\n## Controllable vs Uncontrollable\nThe controllable factors are **interest rates**, **government spending**, and **trade policy**, which are controlled by the government and central banks, such as the US Federal Reserve, which controls interest rates, and the US government, which controls government spending and trade policy. The uncontrollable factors are **inflation expectations**, **consumer confidence**, **business investment**, and **demographic changes**, which are influenced by various factors, including economic conditions, technological changes, and demographic trends.",
