# What Absolute Advantage Depends On

Absolute advantage depends on **technological advancement**, as it requires a country to have a higher productivity level in the production of a particular good or service compared to other countries, which is often achieved through the adoption of advanced technology, such as Boeing's use of automation in aircraft manufacturing, which produces ~800 aircraft annually (Boeing annual report).

## Key Dependencies
- **Technological advancement** — is required for a country to achieve a higher productivity level, and without it, a country may struggle to compete with other nations, as seen in the case of the Indian textile industry, which failed to adopt new technologies and lost its competitive edge to countries like China and Bangladesh, resulting in a significant decline in exports.
- **Skilled labor** — is necessary for the effective use of technology and the production of high-quality goods and services, and without it, a country may experience a decline in productivity, as seen in the case of the Russian aerospace industry, which struggled to replace skilled workers who left the industry after the Soviet Union collapsed.
- **Natural resources** — are essential for the production of certain goods and services, and without access to these resources, a country may be unable to produce these goods and services, as seen in the case of Japan, which lacks significant oil reserves and must import most of its oil, making it vulnerable to fluctuations in global oil prices.
- **Infrastructure** — is critical for the transportation of goods and services, and without it, a country may struggle to get its products to market, as seen in the case of Brazil, which has struggled to develop its transportation infrastructure, resulting in high logistics costs and reduced competitiveness.
- **Institutional framework** — is necessary for providing a stable and predictable business environment, and without it, a country may experience a decline in investment and economic growth, as seen in the case of Venezuela, which has struggled with a weak institutional framework, resulting in a significant decline in foreign investment and economic activity.
- **Trade agreements** — are important for providing access to foreign markets, and without them, a country may struggle to export its goods and services, as seen in the case of the United States, which has benefited from trade agreements like NAFTA, which has increased trade with Canada and Mexico.

## Priority Order
The dependencies can be ranked in the following order from most to least critical:
- **Technological advancement**, as it provides the foundation for productivity growth and competitiveness, and without it, a country may struggle to compete with other nations.
- **Skilled labor**, as it is necessary for the effective use of technology and the production of high-quality goods and services.
- **Institutional framework**, as it provides a stable and predictable business environment, which is necessary for investment and economic growth.
- **Infrastructure**, as it is critical for the transportation of goods and services, and without it, a country may struggle to get its products to market.
- **Natural resources**, as they are essential for the production of certain goods and services, but can be substituted with other resources or imported.
- **Trade agreements**, as they are important for providing access to foreign markets, but can be substituted with other forms of trade, such as export-led growth.

## Common Gaps
People often overlook the importance of **institutional framework** and **infrastructure**, assuming that they are already in place or that they can be easily developed, but the absence of these dependencies can cause significant problems, such as reduced investment and economic growth, as seen in the case of many African countries, which have struggled to develop their institutional frameworks and infrastructure, resulting in reduced economic growth and development.
