# What Absolute Advantage Depends On

Absolute advantage depends on various prerequisites that enable an entity to produce a greater quantity of a good or service than its competitors, and understanding these dependencies is crucial to grasping the concept.

1. INTRODUCTION: 
Absolute advantage refers to the ability of an entity, such as a country or company, to produce more of a good or service than its competitors. The dependencies that underlie absolute advantage are essential to understanding how this concept works, as they provide the foundation upon which it is built. Without these prerequisites, absolute advantage cannot be achieved, and it is therefore vital to comprehend the relationships between these dependencies and the concept itself.

2. KEY DEPENDENCIES: 
- The dependency: Access to natural resources
  Why it's necessary: Natural resources, such as raw materials and labor, are necessary for production, and access to these resources is essential for achieving absolute advantage.
  What happens without it: Without access to natural resources, production cannot occur, and absolute advantage is impossible to achieve, as the entity would be unable to produce any goods or services.
- The dependency: Technological capabilities
  Why it's necessary: Technological capabilities, such as machinery and equipment, are necessary for efficient production, and are a critical component of achieving absolute advantage.
  What happens without it: Without technological capabilities, production would be slow and inefficient, and the entity would be unable to produce a greater quantity of goods or services than its competitors, resulting in a failure to achieve absolute advantage.
- The dependency: Skilled labor
  Why it's necessary: Skilled labor is necessary for efficient production, as it enables the entity to produce high-quality goods or services.
  What happens without it: Without skilled labor, production would be of poor quality, and the entity would be unable to produce a greater quantity of goods or services than its competitors, leading to a failure to achieve absolute advantage.
- The dependency: Infrastructure
  Why it's necessary: Infrastructure, such as transportation and communication systems, is necessary for the efficient production and distribution of goods or services.
  What happens without it: Without infrastructure, production and distribution would be slow and inefficient, and the entity would be unable to produce a greater quantity of goods or services than its competitors, resulting in a failure to achieve absolute advantage.
- The dependency: Economic stability
  Why it's necessary: Economic stability is necessary for investment and production, as it provides a predictable environment for business operations.
  What happens without it: Without economic stability, investment and production would be risky and unpredictable, and the entity would be unable to achieve absolute advantage, as it would be unable to produce a consistent quantity of goods or services.

3. ORDER OF IMPORTANCE: 
While all the dependencies are crucial, access to natural resources and technological capabilities are the most critical, as they provide the foundation for production. Skilled labor and infrastructure are also essential, as they enable efficient production and distribution. Economic stability is also vital, as it provides a predictable environment for business operations.

4. COMMON GAPS: 
People often overlook the importance of economic stability and infrastructure in achieving absolute advantage, assuming that these factors are already in place. However, without these prerequisites, absolute advantage is impossible to achieve, and it is therefore essential to consider these dependencies when evaluating an entity's ability to produce a greater quantity of goods or services than its competitors.

5. SUMMARY: 
The essential foundation for absolute advantage is a combination of prerequisites, including access to natural resources, technological capabilities, skilled labor, infrastructure, and economic stability. Without these dependencies, absolute advantage cannot be achieved, and it is therefore vital to understand the relationships between these prerequisites and the concept itself. By recognizing the importance of these dependencies, entities can take the necessary steps to achieve absolute advantage and produce a greater quantity of goods or services than their competitors.
