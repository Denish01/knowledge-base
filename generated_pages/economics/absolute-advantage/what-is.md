# What Is Absolute Advantage?

## Definition
Absolute advantage is a term coined by Adam Smith in 1776, referring to a country's ability to produce a good or service more efficiently, quickly, or at a lower cost than another country.

## How It Works
Absolute advantage arises when one country has a superior production process, better technology, or more skilled labor, allowing it to produce a larger quantity of a good or service with the same amount of resources. For instance, Boeing produces ~800 aircraft annually (Boeing annual report), leveraging its advanced manufacturing capabilities and economies of scale to achieve a high level of efficiency. This efficiency enables Boeing to maintain a significant market share, with Boeing holding 60% market share (Teal Group). In contrast, countries with limited resources or less advanced technology may struggle to compete in the same markets.

The benefits of absolute advantage can be seen in the example of Saudi Arabia's oil production, where the country's vast oil reserves and favorable geography allow it to extract oil at a significantly lower cost than many other countries. According to the US Energy Information Administration, Saudi Arabia has the second-largest oil reserves in the world, with approximately 298 billion barrels of proven oil reserves. This advantage enables Saudi Arabia to maintain a significant share of the global oil market, with the country producing approximately 12 million barrels of oil per day.

Ricardo's comparative advantage model, 1817, builds upon the idea of absolute advantage by introducing the concept of opportunity cost, which highlights the importance of specializing in the production of goods for which a country has a relative advantage. While absolute advantage focuses on the absolute efficiency of production, comparative advantage emphasizes the relative efficiency of production. This distinction is crucial, as countries with an absolute advantage in multiple industries may still benefit from specializing in the production of goods for which they have a comparative advantage.

## Key Components
- **Production efficiency**: refers to the ability of a country to produce a good or service at a lower cost or with greater speed than another country, which can be achieved through advanced technology, skilled labor, or optimized production processes.
- **Resource allocation**: involves the distribution of resources such as labor, capital, and raw materials to maximize production efficiency, with countries allocating resources to industries where they have an absolute advantage.
- **Economies of scale**: occur when a country or company produces a large quantity of a good or service, reducing the average cost per unit and increasing efficiency, as seen in the example of Boeing's aircraft production.
- **Technological advancements**: can provide a country with an absolute advantage by improving production processes, reducing costs, or increasing the quality of goods and services, such as the use of advanced manufacturing technologies in the automotive industry.
- **Skilled labor**: is essential for maintaining an absolute advantage, as skilled workers can operate complex machinery, develop new technologies, and optimize production processes, with countries investing in education and training programs to develop a skilled workforce.
- **Natural resources**: can provide a country with an absolute advantage, particularly if the country has an abundance of a specific resource, such as oil or minerals, which can be extracted and processed at a lower cost than in other countries.

## Common Misconceptions
**Myth:** Absolute advantage is the only factor determining a country's trade patterns. **Fact:** Comparative advantage, as described by Ricardo's comparative advantage model, 1817, also plays a crucial role in shaping trade patterns, as countries specialize in the production of goods for which they have a relative advantage.
**Myth:** A country with an absolute advantage in one industry will always export that good. **Fact:** The opportunity cost of producing a good can influence a country's decision to export, as seen in the example of the United States, which has an absolute advantage in the production of wheat but also imports wheat from other countries due to regional differences in production costs.
**Myth:** Absolute advantage is a fixed concept, and countries cannot change their absolute advantage over time. **Fact:** Countries can develop new technologies, invest in education and training, or discover new natural resources, which can alter their absolute advantage, such as the development of the oil industry in Norway.
**Myth:** Absolute advantage only applies to the production of goods. **Fact:** Absolute advantage can also apply to the production of services, such as financial services or tourism, where countries with advanced infrastructure, skilled labor, or unique attractions can gain an absolute advantage, as seen in the example of Switzerland's banking industry.

## In Practice
The United States has an absolute advantage in the production of commercial aircraft, with Boeing and Lockheed Martin being two of the largest manufacturers in the world. According to the US Census Bureau, the United States exported approximately $133 billion worth of aircraft and aircraft parts in 2020, with Boeing producing ~800 aircraft annually (Boeing annual report). This absolute advantage is due to a combination of factors, including advanced technology, skilled labor, and significant investments in research and development. As a result, the United States is able to maintain a significant share of the global commercial aircraft market, with Boeing holding 60% market share (Teal Group).
