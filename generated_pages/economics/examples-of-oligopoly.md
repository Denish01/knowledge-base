# What is Examples Of Oligopoly?

1. INTRODUCTION
An oligopoly is a market structure where a small number of firms or companies produce and sell a product or service. This means that instead of many companies competing against each other, only a few large companies dominate the market. These companies often have significant influence over the prices and production levels of their products, which can impact consumers and the overall economy.

2. EVERYDAY EXAMPLES
In many towns and cities, the soft drink market is an example of an oligopoly. For instance, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo are two of the largest soft drink manufacturers in the world, and they often compete against each other in the same markets. In the coffee shop industry, companies like Starbucks, Dunkin' Donuts, and Costa Coffee are major players that dominate the market. The wireless carrier market is another example, where companies like Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, and Sprint provide cellular services to consumers. Additionally, the fast food industry is also an oligopoly, with companies like McDonald's, Burger King, and KFC competing against each other.

3. NOTABLE EXAMPLES
The automobile industry is a classic example of an oligopoly. Companies like General Motors, Ford, and Toyota produce and sell a significant portion of the world's cars and trucks. In the airline industry, companies like American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and United Airlines dominate the market for air travel. The technology industry is also an example, where companies like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon provide a range of products and services, including search engines, operating systems, and cloud computing.

4. EDGE CASES
The market for professional sports leagues is an unusual example of an oligopoly. In the United States, the National Football League (NFL), Major League Baseball (MLB), and the National Basketball Association (NBA) are the dominant leagues for their respective sports. These leagues have significant control over the production and distribution of their products, including games, merchandise, and broadcasting rights. Another example is the market for credit card services, where companies like Visa, Mastercard, and American Express dominate the market for payment processing.

5. NON-EXAMPLES
Some people might think that a small town with many small businesses is an example of an oligopoly, but this is actually an example of a competitive market. In a competitive market, many firms compete against each other, and no single firm has significant influence over the market. Another example that is often confused with an oligopoly is a monopoly, where a single firm has complete control over the market. While an oligopoly has several firms competing against each other, a monopoly has only one firm. A perfectly competitive market, where many firms produce a homogeneous product, is also not an example of an oligopoly.

6. PATTERN
All valid examples of oligopoly have a common characteristic: a small number of firms that dominate the market and have significant influence over prices and production levels. These firms often have barriers to entry, such as high startup costs or significant marketing and advertising expenses, which prevent new firms from entering the market. As a result, the firms in an oligopoly have a degree of pricing power and can influence the overall direction of the market. Whether it's the soft drink industry, the automobile industry, or the technology industry, the pattern of a small number of dominant firms is a key characteristic of an oligopoly.
