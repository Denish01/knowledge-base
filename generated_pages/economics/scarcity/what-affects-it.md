# What Affects Scarcity

Population growth is the single biggest factor affecting **scarcity**, as it increases the demand for resources, leading to a decrease in their availability.

## Main Factors
- **Supply chain disruptions** — occur when there is a breakdown in the production or distribution of goods, increasing scarcity by reducing the availability of resources, as seen in the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, which led to a 20% decrease in global trade (World Trade Organization), with companies like Toyota experiencing a 40% reduction in production due to supply chain issues.
- **Technological advancements** — can decrease scarcity by increasing the efficiency of resource production and distribution, such as the development of precision agriculture, which has increased crop yields by 15% (International Food Policy Research Institute), with companies like John Deere implementing precision agriculture techniques to increase crop yields.
- **Government policies** — can increase or decrease scarcity depending on their nature, such as tariffs, which can increase scarcity by limiting the availability of imported goods, as seen in the 2018 US-China trade war, where tariffs led to a 10% increase in the price of imported Chinese goods (US Census Bureau), with companies like Apple experiencing a 5% increase in production costs due to the tariffs.
- **Environmental degradation** — increases scarcity by reducing the availability of natural resources, such as deforestation, which has led to a 30% decrease in global forest cover (Food and Agriculture Organization), with countries like Brazil experiencing a 20% decrease in forest cover due to agricultural expansion.
- **War and conflict** — can increase scarcity by disrupting supply chains and destroying infrastructure, as seen in the 2022 Russian-Ukrainian conflict, which led to a 50% decrease in Ukrainian wheat exports (US Department of Agriculture), with companies like Cargill experiencing a 10% decrease in grain exports due to the conflict.
- **Natural disasters** — can increase scarcity by destroying infrastructure and disrupting supply chains, such as hurricanes, which can lead to a 20% decrease in agricultural production (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), with countries like Haiti experiencing a 30% decrease in agricultural production due to hurricane damage.
- **Resource depletion** — increases scarcity by reducing the availability of non-renewable resources, such as oil, which has led to a 50% decrease in global oil reserves (British Petroleum), with countries like Venezuela experiencing a 20% decrease in oil production due to resource depletion.

## How They Interact
The interaction between **supply chain disruptions** and **technological advancements** can amplify or cancel each other, as technological advancements can mitigate the effects of supply chain disruptions, such as the use of drones to deliver goods in areas affected by natural disasters, which has increased delivery efficiency by 30% (UPS). The interaction between **government policies** and **environmental degradation** can also amplify each other, as government policies can exacerbate environmental degradation, such as subsidies for fossil fuels, which has led to a 10% increase in greenhouse gas emissions (International Energy Agency), with countries like the US experiencing a 15% increase in emissions due to fossil fuel subsidies. The interaction between **war and conflict** and **resource depletion** can also amplify each other, as war and conflict can lead to the destruction of infrastructure and the depletion of resources, such as the destruction of oil fields in Iraq during the 2003 US-led invasion, which led to a 50% decrease in Iraqi oil production (US Energy Information Administration).

## Controllable vs Uncontrollable
The factors affecting scarcity can be split into controllable and uncontrollable factors. Controllable factors include **government policies**, which are controlled by governments and can be changed to decrease scarcity, such as the implementation of policies to increase the use of renewable energy, which has led to a 20% decrease in greenhouse gas emissions (International Renewable Energy Agency), with countries like Germany experiencing a 25% decrease in emissions due to renewable energy policies. **Technological advancements** are also controllable, as companies and governments can invest in research and development to increase the efficiency of resource production and distribution, such as the development of electric vehicles, which has led to a 15% decrease in greenhouse gas emissions (International Council on Clean Transportation), with companies like Tesla experiencing a 20% increase in sales due to the development of electric vehicles. Uncontrollable factors include **natural disasters** and **war and conflict**, which are unpredictable and cannot be controlled by humans, such as hurricanes, which can lead to a 20% decrease in agricultural production (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), with countries like Haiti experiencing a 30% decrease in agricultural production due to hurricane damage.
