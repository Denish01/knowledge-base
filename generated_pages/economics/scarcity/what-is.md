# What Is Scarcity?

## Definition
Scarcity refers to the fundamental economic problem of having unlimited wants and needs in a world with limited resources, a concept first identified by **Thomas Malthus** in his 1798 work "An Essay on the Principle of Population".

## How It Works
Scarcity arises from the mismatch between the unlimited desires of individuals and the limited availability of resources such as labor, capital, and natural resources. The **law of diminishing returns**, a concept introduced by **David Ricardo** in 1817, states that as the quantity of a variable input, such as labor, increases while holding other inputs constant, the marginal product of that input will eventually decrease. This means that as resources are allocated to meet the increasing demands, their productivity decreases, leading to scarcity. For instance, Boeing produces ~800 aircraft annually (Boeing annual report), but increasing production beyond this point would require significant investments in new resources, leading to diminishing returns.

The scarcity of resources leads to **opportunity costs**, where choosing to allocate resources to one use means forgoing alternative uses. Ricardo's **comparative advantage model** (1817) explains how countries can benefit from trade by specializing in the production of goods for which they have a lower opportunity cost. This model is exemplified by the trade between the United States and China, where the United States exports aircraft worth ~$10 billion annually (US Census Bureau) while importing textiles and electronics from China.

The allocation of scarce resources is further complicated by the presence of **market failures**, such as externalities and information asymmetry. The **Coase theorem**, developed by **Ronald Coase** in 1960, states that in the absence of transaction costs, parties will negotiate to an efficient allocation of resources, regardless of the initial assignment of property rights. However, in reality, transaction costs are significant, leading to market failures and exacerbating scarcity.

## Key Components
- **Resource allocation**: The process of assigning limited resources to meet unlimited wants and needs, with the goal of maximizing efficiency and minimizing waste. As resource allocation increases, the opportunity cost of alternative uses also increases.
- **Opportunity cost**: The value of the next best alternative that is forgone when a choice is made, which increases as resources are allocated to one use rather than another. For example, the opportunity cost of allocating resources to produce aircraft is the value of alternative uses, such as producing automobiles.
- **Diminishing returns**: The decrease in marginal product that occurs as the quantity of a variable input increases, leading to scarcity and reduced productivity. As Boeing increases production beyond ~800 aircraft annually, the law of diminishing returns sets in, reducing productivity.
- **Comparative advantage**: The ability of a country or individual to produce a good or service at a lower opportunity cost than others, leading to specialization and trade. The United States has a comparative advantage in producing aircraft, while China has a comparative advantage in producing textiles.
- **Market failures**: The presence of externalities, information asymmetry, and other imperfections that lead to inefficient allocation of resources and exacerbate scarcity. The Coase theorem highlights the importance of transaction costs in market failures.
- **Transaction costs**: The costs associated with exchanging goods and services, including search and information costs, bargaining costs, and enforcement costs, which can lead to market failures. High transaction costs in the aircraft industry, for example, can lead to inefficiencies in resource allocation.

## Common Misconceptions
**Myth:** Scarcity only applies to material resources — **Fact:** Scarcity also applies to intangible resources such as time and information, as identified by **Gary Becker** in his 1965 work "A Theory of the Allocation of Time". 
**Myth:** Scarcity is only a problem in poor countries — **Fact:** Scarcity is a universal problem that affects all countries, regardless of their level of economic development, as noted by **Milton Friedman** in his 1962 work "Capitalism and Freedom". 
**Myth:** Scarcity can be eliminated through technological progress — **Fact:** While technological progress can increase productivity and reduce scarcity, it cannot eliminate it entirely, as new wants and needs will always arise to replace old ones, a concept discussed by **Joseph Schumpeter** in his 1942 work "Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy".

## In Practice
The scarcity of resources is evident in the aircraft industry, where Boeing and Airbus compete for limited resources such as skilled labor, materials, and manufacturing capacity. Boeing produces ~800 aircraft annually (Boeing annual report), while Airbus produces ~700 aircraft annually (Airbus annual report). The scarcity of resources leads to opportunity costs, where choosing to allocate resources to one use means forgoing alternative uses. For example, Boeing's decision to allocate resources to produce the 787 Dreamliner meant forgoing alternative uses, such as producing more 737 aircraft. The scarcity of resources also leads to market failures, such as externalities and information asymmetry, which can be addressed through mechanisms such as trade and specialization, as explained by Ricardo's comparative advantage model (1817).
