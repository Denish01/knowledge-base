# Types of Scarcity

There are three main categories of **scarcity**, which are organized based on the underlying causes of the scarcity: **demand-induced scarcity**, **supply-induced scarcity**, and **structural scarcity**. 

## Main Categories
- **Demand-induced scarcity** — occurs when the demand for a product or service exceeds its available supply, characterized by a surge in demand that outpaces production capacity, as seen in the case of **Apple's iPhone** releases, where massive demand leads to temporary scarcity.
- **Supply-induced scarcity** — arises when the supply of a product or service is disrupted or reduced, marked by production constraints or supply chain disruptions, exemplified by **De Beers' diamond mining**, where the company controls the supply to create an illusion of scarcity.
- **Structural scarcity** — results from inherent limitations or constraints in the production or distribution of a product or service, distinguished by fundamental barriers such as geographical or technological limitations, as illustrated by **water scarcity in Australia**, where the country's arid climate and limited water resources create a perpetual state of scarcity.

## Comparison Table
| Category | Cost Impact | Scale of Impact | Speed of Onset |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Demand-induced scarcity | High, due to premium pricing | Large, affects entire markets | Rapid, can occur overnight |
| Supply-induced scarcity | Medium to High, depending on production costs | Medium, affects specific industries | Variable, depends on supply chain resilience |
| Structural scarcity | Low to Medium, due to infrastructure investments | Small to Medium, affects specific regions | Gradual, develops over years or decades |

## How They Relate
The categories of scarcity often overlap or feed into each other, leading to complex scarcity dynamics. For instance, **demand-induced scarcity** can lead to **supply-induced scarcity** if the surge in demand overwhelms production capacity, as seen in the case of **Tesla's electric vehicle production**, where high demand has led to supply chain constraints. Similarly, **structural scarcity** can exacerbate **demand-induced scarcity** by limiting the ability to increase production, as in the case of **California's water scarcity**, where geographical and technological limitations constrain water supply, making it difficult to meet growing demand. **Supply-induced scarcity** and **structural scarcity** can also be intertwined, as supply chain disruptions can reveal underlying structural limitations, such as **Boeing's aircraft production**, where supply chain issues have highlighted the company's reliance on a limited number of suppliers.
