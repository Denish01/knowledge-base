# Example of Scarcity

## Definition
Scarcity refers to the fundamental economic problem of having unlimited wants and needs in a world with limited resources, a concept first discussed by Adam Smith in 1776.

## How It Works
Scarcity arises because the needs and desires of individuals are limitless, while the resources available to satisfy these needs are finite. The **production possibility frontier** model, developed by economists such as Paul Samuelson, illustrates the trade-offs between producing different goods and services, given the limited resources available. For instance, Boeing produces ~800 aircraft annually (Boeing annual report), but if it were to increase production, it would have to divert resources from other areas, such as research and development or maintenance. Ricardo's comparative advantage model, 1817, also highlights how countries face scarcity and must make decisions about how to allocate their resources to maximize efficiency.

The scarcity of resources leads to **opportunity costs**, where choosing to produce one good or service means forgoing the production of another. The law of diminishing returns, first described by Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot in 1766, also comes into play, as increasing the quantity of one input, such as labor, while holding others constant, will eventually lead to decreasing marginal returns. This means that as Boeing hires more workers to increase aircraft production, the additional output will eventually decrease, due to the limited availability of other resources, such as materials and equipment.

The allocation of scarce resources is also influenced by **market forces**, such as supply and demand. The price mechanism, described by Leon Walras in 1874, helps to allocate resources efficiently by reflecting the relative scarcity of different goods and services. For example, if the demand for aircraft increases, the price will rise, signaling to Boeing to increase production, which will lead to an allocation of more resources to aircraft production.

## Key Components
- **Limited resources**: The finite availability of resources, such as labor, capital, and raw materials, which constrains the production of goods and services. An increase in limited resources would lead to an increase in production, while a decrease would lead to a decrease in production.
- **Unlimited wants and needs**: The infinite desires and requirements of individuals, which drive the demand for goods and services. An increase in unlimited wants and needs would lead to an increase in demand, while a decrease would lead to a decrease in demand.
- **Opportunity costs**: The value of the next best alternative that is given up when a choice is made, which helps to allocate resources efficiently. An increase in opportunity costs would lead to a decrease in production, while a decrease would lead to an increase in production.
- **Production possibility frontier**: A model that illustrates the trade-offs between producing different goods and services, given the limited resources available. An increase in the production possibility frontier would lead to an increase in production, while a decrease would lead to a decrease in production.
- **Market forces**: The interactions between buyers and sellers that determine the allocation of resources, including the price mechanism. An increase in market forces would lead to an increase in efficiency, while a decrease would lead to a decrease in efficiency.
- **Diminishing returns**: The decrease in marginal output that occurs when one input is increased, while holding others constant. An increase in diminishing returns would lead to a decrease in production, while a decrease would lead to an increase in production.

## Common Misconceptions
**Myth:** Scarcity only applies to developing countries — **Fact:** Scarcity is a universal problem that affects all countries, including developed ones, as evidenced by the fact that even wealthy countries like the United States face scarcity in areas such as healthcare and education.
**Myth:** Scarcity can be eliminated by increasing production — **Fact:** Increasing production can alleviate scarcity in the short term, but it will eventually lead to new scarcity problems, such as environmental degradation or resource depletion, as seen in the case of the oil industry, where increased production has led to concerns about peak oil (Hubbert, 1956).
**Myth:** Scarcity is only an economic problem — **Fact:** Scarcity has social and environmental implications, such as the scarcity of clean water and air, which affects human well-being and the environment, as highlighted by the World Health Organization (WHO).
**Myth:** Scarcity can be solved by government intervention — **Fact:** Government intervention can help alleviate scarcity in the short term, but it can also create new scarcity problems, such as rent control, which can lead to a shortage of housing, as seen in the case of New York City (Glaeser and Gyourko, 2002).

## In Practice
The city of Singapore faces a severe scarcity of land, with a total area of approximately 720 square kilometers (Singapore Government). To address this scarcity, the government has implemented a range of policies, including a **certificate of entitlement** system, which limits the number of new cars that can be registered each year, and a **land-use planning** framework, which prioritizes the use of land for housing, industry, and transportation. The government has also invested heavily in **urban planning** and **infrastructure development**, including the construction of a comprehensive public transportation system and the development of **high-density housing** estates. As a result, Singapore has been able to manage its scarcity of land effectively, with a high population density of over 8,000 people per square kilometer (Singapore Government), while maintaining a high standard of living and a strong economy.
