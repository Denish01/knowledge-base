# What Scarcity Depends On

Scarcity depends on **technological limitations**, as the inability to produce goods and services beyond current technological capabilities directly limits supply, which was evident in the case of the 1970s oil embargo where oil production constraints led to widespread shortages and economic disruption.

## Key Dependencies
- **Human capital** — skilled labor is required to efficiently produce goods and services, and without it, production is severely hindered, as seen in the case of the Soviet Union's attempted industrialization, where a lack of skilled workers led to significant inefficiencies and waste.
- **Natural resources** — the availability of raw materials directly affects production capacity, and depletion or scarcity of these resources can cause significant disruptions, such as the 1970s cobalt shortage that impacted the production of jet engines.
- **Infrastructure** — a well-developed transportation network and storage facilities are necessary for the efficient distribution of goods, and without them, supply chains are severely disrupted, as exemplified by the 2011 Thai floods that destroyed a significant portion of the country's manufacturing infrastructure, leading to global shortages of hard disk drives.
- **Institutional framework** — a stable and predictable legal and regulatory environment is necessary for investment and production, and without it, businesses are reluctant to invest, as seen in the case of Venezuela, where a deteriorating institutional framework has led to a severe decline in oil production.
- **Energy availability** — access to reliable and efficient energy sources is critical for production, and shortages or disruptions can have significant impacts, such as the 2003 Northeast blackout that affected millions of people and caused widespread economic disruption.
- **Information** — accurate and timely information is necessary for decision-making and coordination, and without it, production and distribution are severely impaired, as seen in the case of the 2011 Japanese earthquake and tsunami, where a lack of information about damaged infrastructure and supply chains led to significant delays in relief efforts.

## Priority Order
The dependencies can be ranked in order of criticality as follows:
- **Technological limitations**, as they directly limit production capacity and determine the efficiency of resource use.
- **Human capital**, as skilled labor is necessary for the efficient operation of technology and production processes.
- **Natural resources**, as their availability directly affects production capacity and the ability to meet demand.
- **Energy availability**, as access to reliable energy sources is critical for production and distribution.
- **Infrastructure**, as a well-developed transportation network and storage facilities are necessary for the efficient distribution of goods.
- **Institutional framework**, as a stable and predictable legal and regulatory environment is necessary for investment and production, but can be adapted to or worked around in the short term.

## Common Gaps
People often overlook the importance of **information** in production and distribution, assuming that it will always be available and accurate, but a lack of information can cause significant disruptions, such as the 2011 Japanese earthquake and tsunami, where a lack of information about damaged infrastructure and supply chains led to significant delays in relief efforts. Additionally, the assumption that **technological limitations** can be easily overcome can lead to overinvestment in production capacity, as seen in the case of the Soviet Union's attempted industrialization, where significant investment in technology was not matched by corresponding investments in human capital and institutional framework.
