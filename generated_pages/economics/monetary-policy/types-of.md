# Types of Monetary Policy

There are four main categories of monetary policy, organized by their primary objectives and tools: **Monetary Policy**, **Fiscal Policy**, **Credit Policy**, and **Exchange Rate Policy**.

## Main Categories
- **Expansionary Monetary Policy** — involves increasing the money supply and reducing interest rates to stimulate economic growth, as seen in the Federal Reserve's actions during the 2008 financial crisis, where it lowered the federal funds rate to near zero.
- **Contractionary Monetary Policy** — aims to reduce inflation by decreasing the money supply and increasing interest rates, exemplified by the European Central Bank's decision to raise interest rates in 2011 to combat rising inflation in the eurozone.
- **Credit Policy** — focuses on directing credit towards specific sectors or industries, such as the **credit easing** policies implemented by the Bank of England in 2012 to support small and medium-sized enterprises.
- **Exchange Rate Policy** — involves managing the value of a country's currency to influence trade and investment, as demonstrated by the Swiss National Bank's decision to peg the Swiss franc to the euro in 2011 to prevent excessive appreciation.

## Comparison Table
| Category | Primary Objective | Primary Tool | Risk Level |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Expansionary Monetary Policy | Stimulate economic growth | Interest rates, quantitative easing | Low |
| Contractionary Monetary Policy | Reduce inflation | Interest rates, reserve requirements | Medium |
| Credit Policy | Direct credit to specific sectors | Credit guidelines, interest rates | High |
| Exchange Rate Policy | Influence trade and investment | Currency intervention, exchange rates | High |

## How They Relate
The categories often overlap, as **Expansionary Monetary Policy** can lead to increased borrowing and spending, which may necessitate **Contractionary Monetary Policy** to prevent overheating. **Credit Policy** can be used in conjunction with **Monetary Policy** to target specific industries or sectors. For example, the **quantitative easing** policies implemented by the Federal Reserve during the 2008 financial crisis involved purchasing mortgage-backed securities to support the housing market. Additionally, **Exchange Rate Policy** can influence the effectiveness of **Monetary Policy** by affecting the competitiveness of a country's exports and imports. The **trilemma** of **Monetary Policy**, **Fiscal Policy**, and **Exchange Rate Policy** highlights the challenges of managing these categories simultaneously, as seen in the difficulties faced by the European Central Bank in balancing its **Monetary Policy** objectives with the **Exchange Rate Policy** constraints imposed by the eurozone's fixed exchange rate system.
