  "content": "Monetary policy is the process by which a central bank, such as the Federal Reserve in the United States, uses **interest rates** and the **money supply** to promote maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. The core mechanism involves the central bank setting interest rates, which in turn affects the money supply, aggregate demand, and ultimately, economic growth.\n\n## The Mechanism\nThe central bank's decision to adjust **interest rates** triggers a chain reaction, as lower interest rates increase the **money supply** by making borrowing cheaper, which in turn stimulates aggregate demand, leading to higher economic growth, and ultimately, lower **unemployment rates**. This process is influenced by the **money multiplier**, a measure of the amount of money created by commercial banks, which can amplify the effects of monetary policy, with a money multiplier of 3, for example, resulting in a $3 increase in the money supply for every $1 increase in the **monetary base**.\n\n## Step-by-Step\n1. The central bank sets **interest rates**, such as the federal funds rate, which determines the cost of borrowing for commercial banks, with a lower interest rate, such as 2%, increasing the money supply by $100 billion, according to Ricardo's comparative advantage model.\n2. Commercial banks respond to the lower interest rate by increasing **lending**, which injects more money into the economy, with the average bank lending $10 million per month, resulting in a 5% increase in aggregate demand.\n3. The increased **money supply** reduces the **cost of borrowing** for consumers and businesses, making it cheaper to borrow money, with the average consumer borrowing $5,000 at an interest rate of 6%, resulting in a 10% increase in consumer spending.\n4. As borrowing becomes cheaper, aggregate demand increases, leading to higher **economic growth**, with a 1% decrease in interest rates resulting in a 2% increase in GDP, according to the **Phillips curve** model.\n5. Higher economic growth leads to lower **unemployment rates**, as businesses hire more workers to meet increasing demand, with a 1% decrease in unemployment resulting in a 0.5% increase in labor productivity.\n6. The central bank monitors **inflation rates**, adjusting interest rates as needed to keep inflation within a target range, such as 2%, with a 1% increase in inflation resulting in a 0.5% increase in interest rates.\n\n## Key Components\n- **Central bank**: responsible for setting interest rates and regulating the money supply, with the Federal Reserve holding $4 trillion in assets.\n- **Commercial banks**: play a crucial role in lending and creating new money, with Bank of America holding $2.3 trillion in assets.\n- **Interest rates**: the primary tool used by the central bank to influence the money supply and aggregate demand, with a 1% change in interest rates resulting in a 0.5% change in aggregate demand.\n- **Money supply**: the total amount of money in circulation, including **cash**, **checking accounts**, and other **liquid assets**, with the M2 money supply totaling $15 trillion.\n\n## Common Questions\nWhat happens if the central bank raises interest rates too high? If interest rates are raised too high, it can lead to a decrease in aggregate demand, resulting in higher unemployment rates, such as the 1981 recession, where interest rates rose to 20%, resulting in an unemployment rate of 10.8%. \nWhat is the impact of monetary policy on **exchange rates**? Monetary policy can affect exchange rates, as higher interest rates can attract foreign investors, causing the exchange rate to appreciate, such as the US dollar appreciating by 10% against the euro in 2015.\nHow does monetary policy affect **inflation expectations**? Monetary policy can influence inflation expectations, as a credible central bank can anchor expectations, reducing the risk of **inflationary shocks**, with a 1% decrease in inflation expectations resulting in a 0.5% decrease in inflation.\nWhat is the relationship between monetary policy and **fiscal policy**? Monetary policy and fiscal policy are interconnected, as fiscal policy can influence the effectiveness of monetary policy, with a 1% increase in government spending resulting in a 0.5% increase in aggregate demand.",
