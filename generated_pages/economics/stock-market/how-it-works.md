# How Stock Market Works

The stock market operates through a mechanism of **price discovery**, where the interaction of buyers and sellers determines the prices of **securities** such as stocks and bonds. This mechanism is driven by the exchange of information and capital between market participants, resulting in the allocation of resources to their most valuable uses, as described by Ricardo's comparative advantage model.

## The Mechanism
The core cause-and-effect chain of the stock market involves the interaction of **supply and demand**, where the price of a security is determined by the equilibrium of buyers and sellers. The process of price discovery is facilitated by **stock exchanges**, which provide a platform for market participants to trade securities, with the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) being one of the largest and most well-known examples.

## Step-by-Step
1. **Order submission**: Investors submit **buy and sell orders** to stock exchanges, which are then matched with corresponding orders from other market participants, resulting in a **trade volume** of approximately 6.5 billion shares per day on the NYSE.
2. **Price determination**: The price of a security is determined by the **equilibrium price**, where the number of shares that buyers are willing to buy equals the number of shares that sellers are willing to sell, with the price of a share of Apple stock being around $150 (Apple annual report).
3. **Trade execution**: Trades are executed on stock exchanges, with the **trading volume** and **price** of a security being recorded and disseminated to market participants, such as the 1.4 billion shares traded on the NASDAQ in a single day.
4. **Settlement and clearing**: Trades are settled and cleared through **clearinghouses**, which ensure that the transfer of securities and cash is completed efficiently and securely, with the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) settling over 100 million transactions per day.
5. **Information dissemination**: Market data and news are disseminated to market participants, influencing their investment decisions and contributing to the **efficiency** of the stock market, with Bloomberg processing over 100 billion market data messages per day.
6. **Portfolio rebalancing**: Investors rebalance their portfolios in response to changes in market conditions and their investment objectives, resulting in a **portfolio turnover** of around 50% per year for the average investor (Investment Company Institute).

## Key Components
- **Stock exchanges**: Provide a platform for market participants to trade securities, with the NYSE and NASDAQ being two of the largest exchanges in the world.
- **Broker-dealers**: Act as intermediaries between investors and stock exchanges, executing trades and providing investment advice, such as Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs.
- **Clearinghouses**: Ensure the efficient and secure transfer of securities and cash, such as the DTCC and the Options Clearing Corporation.
- **Market data providers**: Disseminate market data and news to market participants, such as Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters.

## Common Questions
What happens if a stock exchange fails? If a stock exchange fails, trading is halted, and market participants may experience difficulties in buying or selling securities, as seen in the 2013 NASDAQ outage. 
What is the role of a broker-dealer in the stock market? A broker-dealer acts as an intermediary between investors and stock exchanges, executing trades and providing investment advice, with around 4,000 broker-dealers operating in the United States (Financial Industry Regulatory Authority).
How do stock exchanges ensure the integrity of trades? Stock exchanges use various measures, such as **trading halts** and **circuit breakers**, to ensure the integrity of trades and maintain market stability, with the NYSE implementing a **limit up/limit down** mechanism to prevent extreme price movements. 
What is the impact of high-frequency trading on the stock market? High-frequency trading, which involves the use of powerful computers to rapidly execute trades, can contribute to **market volatility**, with around 50% of trading volume in the US stock market attributed to high-frequency traders (TABB Group).
