# Types of Stock Market

There are four main categories of stock markets, organized by their geographical scope and trading characteristics. 
## Main Categories
- **Domestic Stock Market** — a market where securities of domestic companies are traded, distinguished by its focus on the local economy and regulatory environment, as seen in the Tokyo Stock Exchange, which lists companies like Toyota and Honda.
- **Regional Stock Market** — a market that serves companies and investors from a specific geographical region, characterized by its focus on regional economic integration and cooperation, as exemplified by the European Stock Exchange, which includes the London Stock Exchange and lists companies like Royal Dutch Shell and BP.
- **Global Stock Market** — a market that provides a platform for companies to raise capital and for investors to buy and sell securities from around the world, marked by its international scope and diverse listings, such as the New York Stock Exchange, which lists companies like Apple and Microsoft.
- **Emerging Market** — a market characterized by low market capitalization, limited liquidity, and a high growth potential, often associated with developing economies, as seen in the Shanghai Stock Exchange, which lists companies like Alibaba and Tencent, with ~3,000 listings (Shanghai Stock Exchange annual report).

## Comparison Table
| Category | Cost of Listing | Scale of Trading | Risk Profile |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Domestic Stock Market | Lower listing fees, e.g., Tokyo Stock Exchange charges ~$10,000 (Tokyo Stock Exchange) | Smaller trading volumes, e.g., ~$500 billion daily (Tokyo Stock Exchange) | Lower risk due to familiar regulatory environment |
| Regional Stock Market | Moderate listing fees, e.g., European Stock Exchange charges ~$50,000 (European Stock Exchange) | Medium trading volumes, e.g., ~$1 trillion daily (European Stock Exchange) | Moderate risk due to regional economic integration |
| Global Stock Market | Higher listing fees, e.g., New York Stock Exchange charges ~$100,000 (New York Stock Exchange) | Larger trading volumes, e.g., ~$5 trillion daily (New York Stock Exchange) | Higher risk due to global economic exposure |
| Emerging Market | Variable listing fees, e.g., Shanghai Stock Exchange charges ~$5,000 (Shanghai Stock Exchange) | Smaller trading volumes, e.g., ~$100 billion daily (Shanghai Stock Exchange) | Higher risk due to limited liquidity and regulatory uncertainty |

## How They Relate
The categories often overlap, with domestic stock markets feeding into regional and global markets as companies grow and expand their operations. For example, a company listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange may also be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, allowing it to access a broader investor base. Regional stock markets, such as the European Stock Exchange, may also be part of a global stock market, providing companies with access to a larger market. Emerging markets, like the Shanghai Stock Exchange, may be considered part of a regional or global market, depending on the company's international exposure and growth prospects. Specific pairs, such as the Tokyo Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange, are commonly linked through cross-listings and international trading agreements, facilitating the flow of capital and securities between markets.
