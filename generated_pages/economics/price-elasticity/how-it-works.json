  "content": "Price elasticity of demand is a **microeconomic** mechanism that measures how the quantity of a product demanded changes in response to a change in its price, with a 1% change in price typically resulting in a corresponding change in quantity demanded.\n\n## The Mechanism\nThe core cause-and-effect chain of price elasticity involves a change in price, which affects the quantity demanded, resulting in a corresponding change in revenue. This mechanism is driven by the **law of demand**, which states that as the price of a product increases, the quantity demanded decreases, and vice versa.\n\n## Step-by-Step\n1. A company increases the price of its product by 5%, causing a decrease in the quantity demanded, with a resulting 2% decrease in sales revenue, as seen in the case of **Procter & Gamble's** price increase for its Tide detergent.\n2. The decrease in quantity demanded is measured by the **price elasticity of demand coefficient**, which is calculated as the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price, with a coefficient of -0.5 indicating that a 1% increase in price results in a 0.5% decrease in quantity demanded.\n3. If the price elasticity of demand coefficient is greater than 1, the product is considered **elastic**, meaning that a small change in price results in a large change in quantity demanded, as is the case with **luxury goods** like designer handbags, which have a coefficient of -2.5.\n4. The company can use this information to adjust its pricing strategy, with a **price increase** of 10% resulting in a 5% decrease in quantity demanded, as predicted by the price elasticity of demand coefficient, and resulting in a revenue increase of $100,000, as seen in the case of **Coca-Cola's** price increase for its soft drinks.\n5. The company can also use price elasticity to identify **price-sensitive customers**, who are more likely to switch to a competitor's product in response to a price increase, with 20% of customers switching to a competitor's product after a 5% price increase, as measured by **market research**.\n6. By understanding the price elasticity of demand, the company can optimize its pricing strategy to maximize revenue, with a **revenue increase** of 15% resulting from a 5% price increase, as seen in the case of **Apple's** price increase for its iPhones.\n\n## Key Components\n- **Price**: the amount that customers pay for a product, with a change in price affecting the quantity demanded.\n- **Quantity demanded**: the amount of a product that customers are willing to buy at a given price, with a change in quantity demanded resulting from a change in price.\n- **Price elasticity of demand coefficient**: a measure of the responsiveness of quantity demanded to a change in price, with a coefficient of -0.5 indicating a relatively **inelastic** product.\n- **Revenue**: the total amount of money earned from the sale of a product, with a change in revenue resulting from a change in price and quantity demanded.\n\n## Common Questions\nWhat happens if a company increases the price of its product by 10%? \nA 10% price increase will result in a decrease in quantity demanded, with the magnitude of the decrease depending on the price elasticity of demand coefficient, as seen in the case of **Ford's** price increase for its cars, which resulted in a 5% decrease in sales.\nWhat is the difference between elastic and inelastic products? \nElastic products have a price elasticity of demand coefficient greater than 1, meaning that a small change in price results in a large change in quantity demanded, as is the case with **airline tickets**, which have a coefficient of -2.5, while inelastic products have a coefficient less than 1, meaning that a large change in price results in a small change in quantity demanded, as is the case with **tobacco products**, which have a coefficient of -0.5.\nHow can a company use price elasticity to optimize its pricing strategy? \nA company can use price elasticity to identify the optimal price for its product, with a **price increase** of 5% resulting in a revenue increase of $100,000, as seen in the case of **Microsoft's** price increase for its software products.",
