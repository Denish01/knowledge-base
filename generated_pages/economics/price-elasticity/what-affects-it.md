# What Affects Price Elasticity

The availability of **substitutes** is the single biggest factor affecting price elasticity, as it increases elasticity by providing consumers with alternative options, such as Coca-Cola and Pepsi, where a 10% price increase in Coca-Cola can lead to a 15% decrease in sales as consumers switch to Pepsi.

## Main Factors
- **Income level** — affects price elasticity by increasing it for luxury goods and decreasing it for essential goods, as a 10% increase in income can lead to a 20% increase in demand for luxury cars, while a 10% decrease in income can lead to only a 5% decrease in demand for essential goods like food.
- **Substitutes** — increases price elasticity by providing alternative options, such as the 15% decrease in Coca-Cola sales mentioned earlier, and a 10% price increase in Apple iPhones can lead to a 12% decrease in sales as consumers switch to Samsung or Google phones.
- **Consumer budget share** — decreases price elasticity for essential goods, as a 10% price increase in housing can lead to only a 2% decrease in demand, while a 10% price increase in entertainment can lead to a 10% decrease in demand.
- **Time period** — affects price elasticity by increasing it in the long run, as consumers have more time to adjust to price changes, such as a 10% price increase in gasoline leading to a 5% decrease in demand in the short run, but a 15% decrease in demand in the long run as consumers switch to more fuel-efficient cars or public transportation.
- **Advertising** — decreases price elasticity by creating brand loyalty, such as a 10% price increase in Nike shoes leading to only a 5% decrease in sales due to the brand's strong marketing and customer loyalty.
- **Production costs** — affects price elasticity by increasing it for goods with high production costs, such as a 10% increase in labor costs leading to a 12% increase in the price of clothing, which can result in a 10% decrease in demand.
- **Market structure** — affects price elasticity by increasing it in competitive markets, such as the airline industry, where a 10% price increase by one airline can lead to a 15% decrease in sales as consumers switch to other airlines.

## How They Interact
The interaction between **substitutes** and **advertising** can amplify the effect on price elasticity, as strong advertising can create brand loyalty and reduce the impact of substitutes, such as Apple's advertising creating a loyal customer base that is less likely to switch to Samsung or Google phones. The interaction between **income level** and **consumer budget share** can also cancel each other out, as a decrease in income can lead to a decrease in demand for luxury goods, but an increase in budget share for essential goods can lead to an increase in demand, such as a 10% decrease in income leading to a 15% decrease in demand for luxury cars, but only a 2% decrease in demand for essential goods like food. The interaction between **time period** and **production costs** can also affect price elasticity, as an increase in production costs in the short run can lead to a larger price increase and a larger decrease in demand, but in the long run, consumers can adjust to the price change and demand may decrease less, such as a 10% increase in labor costs leading to a 12% increase in the price of clothing, which can result in a 15% decrease in demand in the short run, but only a 10% decrease in demand in the long run.

## Controllable vs Uncontrollable
The controllable factors are **advertising**, **production costs**, and **market structure**, which can be controlled by businesses, governments, and regulatory bodies, such as the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) regulating advertising practices. The uncontrollable factors are **income level**, **substitutes**, **consumer budget share**, and **time period**, which are determined by external factors such as economic conditions, consumer preferences, and technological advancements. Businesses can control their advertising strategies, such as targeting specific demographics or creating brand loyalty, and can also control their production costs, such as by outsourcing to low-cost countries or investing in automation. Governments and regulatory bodies can control market structure, such as by enforcing antitrust laws or regulating monopolies.
