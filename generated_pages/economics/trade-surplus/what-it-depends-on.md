# What Trade Surplus Depends On

A country's **trade surplus** depends on its **competitive advantage** in producing goods and services that are in high demand globally, as explained by Ricardo's comparative advantage model. 
## Key Dependencies
- **Competitive advantage** — a country needs to have a lower opportunity cost of production in a particular industry to achieve a trade surplus, and without it, the country will struggle to export goods, as seen in the case of the US textile industry, which declined significantly due to competition from low-wage countries like China and Vietnam.
- **Infrastructural capacity** — a well-developed transportation network, including roads, ports, and airports, is necessary for efficient export and import of goods, and a lack of it can lead to bottlenecks and increased costs, as experienced by Brazil, where inadequate port infrastructure has hindered the country's ability to export soybeans and other agricultural products.
- **Trade agreements** — favorable trade agreements, such as free trade agreements or customs unions, can reduce tariffs and other trade barriers, making a country's exports more competitive, and without them, exports may decline, as seen in the case of the UK, which faced increased trade barriers after leaving the EU.
- **Exchange rate stability** — a stable exchange rate is necessary to maintain the competitiveness of a country's exports, and a volatile exchange rate can make exports more expensive and less competitive, as experienced by Australia, where a strong currency made its exports less competitive in the global market.
- **Domestic market size** — a large domestic market can provide a country with the economies of scale necessary to achieve a trade surplus, and a small domestic market can limit a country's ability to achieve economies of scale, as seen in the case of New Zealand, where the small domestic market limits the country's ability to achieve economies of scale in industries like manufacturing.
- **Human capital** — a skilled and educated workforce is necessary to produce high-quality goods and services that are in demand globally, and a lack of human capital can limit a country's ability to achieve a trade surplus, as experienced by Bangladesh, where a shortage of skilled workers has hindered the country's ability to move up the value chain in industries like textiles.

## Priority Order
The dependencies can be ranked in the following order from most to least critical:
- **Competitive advantage**, as it is the foundation of a country's ability to achieve a trade surplus, and without it, the country will struggle to export goods.
- **Infrastructural capacity**, as it is necessary for efficient export and import of goods, and a lack of it can lead to significant costs and bottlenecks.
- **Trade agreements**, as they can reduce tariffs and other trade barriers, making a country's exports more competitive.
- **Exchange rate stability**, as a volatile exchange rate can make exports more expensive and less competitive.
- **Domestic market size**, as a large domestic market can provide a country with the economies of scale necessary to achieve a trade surplus.
- **Human capital**, as a skilled and educated workforce is necessary to produce high-quality goods and services, but can be developed over time with investment in education and training.

## Common Gaps
People often overlook the importance of **infrastructural capacity** and **exchange rate stability** in achieving a trade surplus, assuming that a country's competitive advantage is enough to drive exports, but neglecting the fact that a lack of infrastructural capacity can lead to bottlenecks and increased costs, and a volatile exchange rate can make exports less competitive, as seen in the case of South Africa, where a lack of investment in infrastructure has hindered the country's ability to export goods, and a volatile exchange rate has made its exports less competitive.
