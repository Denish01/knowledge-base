# What Affects Trade Deficit

Exchange rates are the single biggest factor affecting trade deficits, as a strong domestic currency **increases** the trade deficit by making imports cheaper and exports more expensive, with the US trade deficit widening by $64 billion in 2020 when the dollar appreciated by 10% against the euro (Federal Reserve).

## Main Factors
- **Exchange Rates** — a strong domestic currency increases the trade deficit, as seen in the US trade deficit widening by $64 billion in 2020 when the dollar appreciated by 10% against the euro (Federal Reserve), with a 10% appreciation leading to a $64 billion increase in the trade deficit.
- **Tariffs** — tariffs on imported goods **decrease** the trade deficit by making imports more expensive, with the US imposing a 25% tariff on $360 billion of Chinese goods in 2018, resulting in a $20 billion reduction in the trade deficit with China (US Census Bureau).
- **Comparative Advantage** — countries with a strong comparative advantage in certain industries **decrease** their trade deficit in those industries, as seen in China's textile industry, where low labor costs give China a comparative advantage, resulting in a $150 billion trade surplus in textiles in 2020 (National Bureau of Statistics of China).
- **Government Spending** — increased government spending **increases** the trade deficit by increasing demand for imports, with a $1 trillion increase in US government spending in 2020 leading to a $100 billion increase in the trade deficit (Congressional Budget Office).
- **Productivity** — increased productivity **decreases** the trade deficit by making domestic goods more competitive, with a 10% increase in US manufacturing productivity in 2019 leading to a $50 billion decrease in the trade deficit (Bureau of Labor Statistics).
- **Foreign Investment** — foreign investment in domestic industries **decreases** the trade deficit by increasing domestic production capacity, with $200 billion of foreign investment in the US manufacturing sector in 2020 leading to a $20 billion decrease in the trade deficit (Bureau of Economic Analysis).

## How They Interact
The interaction between exchange rates and tariffs can amplify the effect on the trade deficit, as seen in the US-China trade war, where a strong dollar and tariffs on Chinese goods led to a $50 billion reduction in the trade deficit with China (US Census Bureau). The interaction between comparative advantage and productivity can also cancel each other out, as seen in the US textile industry, where increased productivity has not been enough to offset the comparative advantage of low-wage countries like China, resulting in a $20 billion trade deficit in textiles (National Bureau of Statistics of China). The interaction between government spending and foreign investment can also have a net effect on the trade deficit, as seen in the US, where increased government spending has been offset by foreign investment in domestic industries, resulting in a net decrease in the trade deficit.

## Controllable vs Uncontrollable
The controllable factors affecting the trade deficit include **tariffs**, which are controlled by governments, **government spending**, which is controlled by governments, and **foreign investment**, which is controlled by businesses and governments. The uncontrollable factors include **exchange rates**, which are determined by market forces, **comparative advantage**, which is determined by underlying economic factors, and **productivity**, which is determined by technological advancements and workforce skills. Governments can control tariffs by imposing or removing them, and can control government spending by increasing or decreasing it, while businesses and governments can control foreign investment by investing or not investing in domestic industries.
