# Types of Trade Deficit

There are three main categories of trade deficit, classified based on the type of goods and services being traded: **Visible Trade Deficit**, **Invisible Trade Deficit**, and **Structural Trade Deficit**. 
## Main Categories
- **Visible Trade Deficit** — a deficit that occurs when a country imports more visible goods, such as commodities and manufactured products, than it exports, as seen in the case of the United States' trade deficit with China, where the US imports large quantities of electronics and machinery.
- **Invisible Trade Deficit** — a deficit that occurs when a country imports more invisible goods and services, such as tourism and financial services, than it exports, as exemplified by the UK's trade deficit in tourism, where more British citizens travel abroad than foreign tourists visit the UK.
- **Structural Trade Deficit** — a deficit that occurs due to underlying structural issues in a country's economy, such as a lack of competitiveness or a strong currency, as illustrated by Japan's trade deficit, which is partly caused by the country's aging population and declining manufacturing sector.

## Comparison Table
| Category | Cost | Scale | Speed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Visible Trade Deficit** | High import costs, such as tariffs and transportation costs (World Trade Organization) | Large scale, involving significant volumes of goods | Slow, as visible goods require time to produce and transport |
| **Invisible Trade Deficit** | Low import costs, as invisible goods and services do not require physical transportation | Small to medium scale, involving services and intangible goods | Fast, as invisible goods and services can be delivered quickly through digital means |
| **Structural Trade Deficit** | High opportunity costs, as structural issues can limit a country's economic growth (Ricardo's comparative advantage model, 1817) | Large scale, involving underlying economic structures | Slow, as addressing structural issues requires significant time and effort |

## How They Relate
The categories of trade deficit can overlap and feed into each other, with **Visible Trade Deficit** and **Invisible Trade Deficit** often contributing to a **Structural Trade Deficit**. For example, a country with a large **Visible Trade Deficit** may also experience a **Structural Trade Deficit** due to underlying issues with its manufacturing sector. Similarly, a country with a significant **Invisible Trade Deficit** in tourism may also experience a **Structural Trade Deficit** due to a lack of competitiveness in its tourism industry. Specific pairs, such as **Visible Trade Deficit** and **Structural Trade Deficit**, are commonly confused, as a country's visible trade deficit can be a symptom of deeper structural issues.
