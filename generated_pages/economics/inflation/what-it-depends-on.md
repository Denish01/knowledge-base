# What Inflation Depends On

Money supply is the most critical dependency for inflation, as it directly affects the amount of currency in circulation, which in turn drives prices up or down. 
## Key Dependencies
- **Money Supply** — an increase in money supply leads to more currency in circulation, causing prices to rise, while a decrease leads to deflation, as seen in Japan's experience with deflation (Bank of Japan) where money supply contraction led to persistently low inflation. 
- **Economic Growth** — a strong economy with high demand for goods and services drives up prices, whereas a recession leads to decreased demand and lower prices, as evidenced by the 2008 financial crisis where GDP contraction led to deflationary pressures (IMF).
- **Interest Rates** — low interest rates increase borrowing and spending, driving up prices, while high interest rates have the opposite effect, as seen in the US Federal Reserve's rate hikes in 2018, which slowed down inflation (Federal Reserve).
- **Commodity Prices** — fluctuations in commodity prices, such as oil, can have a significant impact on inflation, as higher commodity prices lead to increased production costs and higher prices for consumers, as experienced during the 1970s oil embargo (US Energy Information Administration).
- **Exchange Rates** — a weak exchange rate can lead to higher import prices, driving up inflation, while a strong exchange rate can lead to lower import prices and reduced inflation, as seen in the UK's experience with a weak pound after the Brexit referendum (Bank of England).
- **Supply Chain Disruptions** — disruptions to supply chains, such as natural disasters or trade wars, can lead to shortages and higher prices, as seen in the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, which caused widespread supply chain disruptions and price increases (World Trade Organization).

## Priority Order
The priority order of these dependencies is as follows:
- **Money Supply**, as it has the most direct impact on inflation, with changes in money supply having an immediate effect on prices.
- **Economic Growth**, as a strong or weak economy has a significant impact on demand and prices.
- **Interest Rates**, as they influence borrowing and spending, which in turn affect prices.
- **Commodity Prices**, as fluctuations in commodity prices can have a significant impact on production costs and consumer prices.
- **Exchange Rates**, as they affect import prices and can have a significant impact on inflation.
- **Supply Chain Disruptions**, as while they can have a significant impact on prices, they are often temporary and can be mitigated through diversification and other strategies.

## Common Gaps
People often overlook the impact of **Supply Chain Disruptions** on inflation, assuming that prices will quickly return to normal after a disruption, but as seen in the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain disruptions can have a lasting impact on prices, Ricardo's comparative advantage model, 1817, highlights the importance of supply chains in determining prices. Another common gap is the assumption that **Exchange Rates** only affect import prices, when in fact they can have a broader impact on the economy, as seen in the UK's experience with a weak pound after the Brexit referendum, where the weak exchange rate led to higher import prices and increased inflation.
