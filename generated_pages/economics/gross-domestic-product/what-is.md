# What Is Gross Domestic Product?

## Definition
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the total value of all final goods and services produced within a country's borders over a specific time period, a concept first introduced by Simon Kuznets in 1934.

## How It Works
GDP calculation involves adding up the value of **consumption**, **investment**, **government spending**, and **net exports**. The **expenditure approach** is one of the methods used to calculate GDP, where the total value of goods and services is calculated by adding up the amount spent by households, businesses, government, and foreigners on domestic output. For instance, Boeing produces ~800 aircraft annually (Boeing annual report), and the value of these aircraft is included in the US GDP. The **income approach** is another method, which calculates GDP by adding up the income earned by households and businesses, including **wages**, **rents**, and **profits**.

The **production approach**, also known as the value-added approach, calculates GDP by adding up the value added at each stage of production. This approach helps to avoid double-counting, as it only includes the value added by each firm, rather than the total value of the goods and services produced. Ricardo's comparative advantage model (1817) explains how countries can benefit from trade by specializing in the production of goods and services in which they have a comparative advantage, which in turn affects their GDP.

GDP can be calculated on a **nominal** or **real** basis, with the latter adjusting for **inflation**. The **GDP deflator** is a measure of the overall level of prices in the economy, and it is used to convert nominal GDP to real GDP. The **World Bank** reports that the global GDP was approximately $88 trillion in 2020, with the **United States** accounting for around 25% of the total.

## Key Components
- **Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE)**: This component accounts for the largest share of GDP, around 70% in the US, and includes spending by households on goods and services, such as food, housing, and transportation.
- **Gross Investment**: This component includes spending by businesses on capital goods, such as new buildings, equipment, and inventories, which helps to increase the economy's productive capacity.
- **Government Spending**: This component includes spending by federal, state, and local governments on goods and services, such as defense, education, and infrastructure, which can help to stimulate economic growth.
- **Net Exports**: This component includes the value of exports minus the value of imports, and it can have a significant impact on a country's GDP, as seen in the case of **China**, which has become one of the world's largest exporters.
- **Inflation**: This component can affect the purchasing power of consumers and the value of GDP, and it is measured by the **Consumer Price Index (CPI)**, which has been used by the **Bureau of Labor Statistics** since 1913.
- **Productivity**: This component can affect the growth rate of GDP, as seen in the case of **Singapore**, which has experienced rapid economic growth due to its high productivity levels.

## Common Misconceptions
**Myth:** GDP is a perfect measure of a country's economic well-being — **Fact:** GDP does not account for income inequality, as seen in the case of **Brazil**, where the richest 10% of the population holds around 40% of the country's income (World Bank).
**Myth:** GDP only includes goods and services produced within a country's borders — **Fact:** GDP includes goods and services produced by a country's citizens and businesses, regardless of where they are located, as seen in the case of **Ireland**, where many multinational companies have operations.
**Myth:** GDP is only calculated on a national level — **Fact:** GDP can be calculated for **regional** and **local** areas, such as the **European Union**, which reports GDP for its member states.
**Myth:** GDP is a measure of a country's **standard of living** — **Fact:** GDP per capita is a more accurate measure of a country's standard of living, as it takes into account the population size, such as in the case of **Qatar**, which has a high GDP per capita due to its small population and large oil reserves.

## In Practice
The US GDP has been growing steadily over the past decade, with a growth rate of around 2% per annum. In 2020, the US GDP was approximately $22 trillion, with the **service sector** accounting for around 80% of the total. The **federal government** has implemented policies to stimulate economic growth, such as tax cuts and increased government spending, which have helped to boost GDP. For instance, the **American Recovery and Reinvestment Act** of 2009 provided around $800 billion in stimulus funding, which helped to increase GDP by around 2% in the following year.
