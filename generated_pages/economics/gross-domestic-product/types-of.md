# Types of Gross Domestic Product

There are four main categories of **Gross Domestic Product (GDP)**, organized by the expenditure approach, income approach, and production approach, which provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the different types of GDP. 
## Main Categories
- **Nominal GDP** — measures the total value of goods and services produced within a country's borders, valued at current market prices, as seen in the United States' nominal GDP, which was approximately $22.67 trillion in 2020 (Bureau of Economic Analysis).
- **Real GDP** — measures the total value of goods and services produced within a country's borders, adjusted for inflation, and valued at constant prices, such as the real GDP of Japan, which grew at an average annual rate of 1.2% from 2000 to 2020 (World Bank data).
- **GDP at Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)** — measures the total value of goods and services produced within a country's borders, adjusted for differences in the cost of living between countries, as exemplified by China's GDP at PPP, which was approximately $25.63 trillion in 2020 (International Monetary Fund).
- **Gross National Income (GNI)** — measures the total income earned by a country's citizens, including income from abroad, such as the GNI of Germany, which was approximately $4.24 trillion in 2020 (World Bank data).

## Comparison Table
| Category | Calculation Method | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Nominal GDP | Total value of goods and services at current market prices | United States: $22.67 trillion (2020) |
| Real GDP | Total value of goods and services at constant prices | Japan: 1.2% average annual growth rate (2000-2020) |
| GDP at PPP | Total value of goods and services adjusted for cost of living differences | China: $25.63 trillion (2020) |
| GNI | Total income earned by a country's citizens, including income from abroad | Germany: $4.24 trillion (2020) |

## How They Relate
The categories of GDP are interconnected, with **Nominal GDP** serving as the basis for calculating **Real GDP**, which in turn is used to calculate **GDP at PPP**. **GNI** is related to **GDP** but includes income from abroad, such as **remittances**, which can be a significant component of a country's total income, as seen in the case of Mexico, where remittances accounted for approximately 3% of the country's GDP in 2020 (World Bank data). The distinction between **GDP** and **GNI** is often blurred, but **Ricardo's comparative advantage model** highlights the importance of considering the income earned by a country's citizens, rather than just the value of goods and services produced within its borders. Additionally, **Marx's labor theory of value** emphasizes the importance of considering the income earned by workers, rather than just the value of goods and services produced. The relationship between **GDP at PPP** and **Nominal GDP** is also important, as it allows for comparisons of the standard of living between countries, such as the comparison between the United States and China, where the GDP at PPP of China is higher than that of the United States, despite having a lower nominal GDP.
