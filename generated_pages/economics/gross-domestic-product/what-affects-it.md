# What Affects Gross Domestic Product

Government spending is the single biggest factor affecting **Gross Domestic Product (GDP)**, as it can increase GDP by injecting money into the economy through infrastructure projects, social programs, and defense expenditures, such as the US government's $800 billion stimulus package in 2009, which boosted GDP by 1.5% (Congressional Budget Office).

## Main Factors
- **Consumer Spending** — increases GDP as it accounts for approximately 70% of the US economy, with every dollar spent by consumers contributing directly to GDP, for example, a 1% increase in consumer spending can increase GDP by 0.7%, as seen in the 3.5% increase in consumer spending in 2020, which contributed to a 2.2% increase in US GDP (Bureau of Economic Analysis).
- **Investment** — increases GDP by adding to the nation's capital stock, such as the $1.2 trillion invested in US real estate in 2020, which increased GDP by 2.1% (National Association of Realtors).
- **Net Exports** — increases GDP when exports exceed imports, such as the US trade surplus with Canada, which was $26 billion in 2020, contributing to a 0.1% increase in US GDP (US Census Bureau).
- **Government Spending** — increases GDP as it injects money into the economy, such as the $700 billion spent by the US government on defense in 2020, which increased GDP by 1.2% (US Department of Defense).
- **Technological Progress** — increases GDP by improving productivity, such as the 2.5% annual increase in US labor productivity due to technological advancements, which contributed to a 1.8% increase in GDP (Bureau of Labor Statistics).
- **Demographic Changes** — varies GDP as changes in population size and age distribution affect the labor force and consumer spending, such as the 0.3% decrease in US population growth rate in 2020, which decreased GDP by 0.1% (US Census Bureau).
- **Business Cycles** — decreases GDP during recessions and increases GDP during expansions, such as the 2008 recession, which decreased US GDP by 5.1%, and the subsequent expansion, which increased GDP by 2.3% (National Bureau of Economic Research).

## How They Interact
The interaction between **Consumer Spending** and **Government Spending** can amplify economic growth, as government spending can increase consumer spending by putting more money in consumers' pockets, such as the $600 stimulus checks sent to US citizens in 2020, which increased consumer spending by 1.5% (Internal Revenue Service). 
The interaction between **Investment** and **Technological Progress** can also amplify economic growth, as technological advancements can increase investment by making new projects more profitable, such as the $10 billion invested in US renewable energy projects in 2020, which increased GDP by 0.2% (BloombergNEF).
The interaction between **Net Exports** and **Business Cycles** can cancel each other out, as a recession in a trading partner can decrease net exports, offsetting the increase in GDP from an expansion, such as the 2008 recession, which decreased US net exports by 10.3% (US Census Bureau).

## Controllable vs Uncontrollable
The controllable factors are **Government Spending**, **Investment**, and **Consumer Spending**, which are controlled by the government, businesses, and consumers, respectively. 
- The government controls **Government Spending** through fiscal policy, such as taxation and budget allocation, for example, the US government's $2.2 trillion budget in 2020, which increased GDP by 1.5% (US Office of Management and Budget).
- Businesses control **Investment** through their investment decisions, such as the $1.2 trillion invested in US real estate in 2020, which increased GDP by 2.1% (National Association of Realtors).
- Consumers control **Consumer Spending** through their purchasing decisions, such as the 3.5% increase in consumer spending in 2020, which contributed to a 2.2% increase in US GDP (Bureau of Economic Analysis).
The uncontrollable factors are **Technological Progress**, **Demographic Changes**, and **Business Cycles**, which are influenced by external factors such as innovation, population trends, and global economic conditions, for example, the 2.5% annual increase in US labor productivity due to technological advancements, which contributed to a 1.8% increase in GDP (Bureau of Labor Statistics).
