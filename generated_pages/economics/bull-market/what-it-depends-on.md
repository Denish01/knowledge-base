# What Bull Market Depends On

Monetary policy stability is the most critical dependency for a **bull market**, as it directly influences interest rates and investor confidence, with a notable example being the 1994 bond market crisis, where the Federal Reserve's unexpected interest rate hikes led to a significant decline in bond prices and a subsequent market downturn.

## Key Dependencies
- **Economic Growth** — a steady increase in GDP is necessary to support a bull market, as it indicates a healthy economy with growing consumer spending and business investment, and without it, the market may decline, as seen in the 2008 financial crisis, where a recession led to a significant decline in stock prices.
- **Low Inflation** — a stable and low inflation rate is required to maintain investor confidence and prevent erosion of purchasing power, and high inflation, such as in the 1970s, can lead to decreased investor confidence and a bear market.
- **Fiscal Policy** — a balanced and sustainable fiscal policy is necessary to support economic growth and prevent excessive debt, and a failure to do so, such as in Greece's debt crisis, can lead to a loss of investor confidence and a market downturn.
- **Regulatory Environment** — a stable and supportive regulatory environment is necessary to promote business growth and investment, and a lack of clear regulations, such as in the lead-up to the 2008 financial crisis, can lead to market instability and a decline in investor confidence.
- **Market Liquidity** — sufficient market liquidity is necessary to facilitate buying and selling, and a lack of liquidity, such as during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, can lead to significant market volatility and a decline in investor confidence.

## Priority Order
Ranking the dependencies from most to least critical:
- **Monetary Policy Stability** is the most critical, as it directly influences interest rates and investor confidence.
- **Economic Growth** is the second most critical, as it indicates a healthy economy with growing consumer spending and business investment.
- **Low Inflation** is the third most critical, as high inflation can lead to decreased investor confidence and a bear market.
- **Fiscal Policy** is the fourth most critical, as a balanced and sustainable fiscal policy is necessary to support economic growth and prevent excessive debt.
- **Regulatory Environment** is the fifth most critical, as a stable and supportive regulatory environment is necessary to promote business growth and investment.
- **Market Liquidity** is the least critical, but still essential, as sufficient market liquidity is necessary to facilitate buying and selling.

## Common Gaps
A common assumption that people overlook is that **bull markets** can continue indefinitely without any corrections, which can lead to complacency and a failure to prepare for potential downturns, as seen in the 2000 dot-com bubble, where investors assumed that the market would continue to rise indefinitely, leading to a significant decline in stock prices when the bubble burst.
