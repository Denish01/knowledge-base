# How Bull Market Works

Bull market is a prolonged period of time when the stock market experiences a significant upward trend, with **stock prices** rising by at least 20% over a two-month period, as defined by the **Dow Theory**. This mechanism is driven by a complex interplay of economic factors, including **interest rates**, **inflation**, and **consumer confidence**, which ultimately lead to increased **investment** and higher **stock prices**.

## The Mechanism
The core cause-and-effect chain of a bull market involves an increase in **economic growth**, which leads to higher **corporate earnings**, and in turn, causes **stock prices** to rise. As **stock prices** increase, more investors become confident in the market, leading to increased **investment** and further driving up **stock prices**.

## Step-by-1
1. An increase in **economic growth**, measured by a 3% rise in **GDP**, leads to higher **corporate earnings**, with **S&P 500** companies experiencing a 10% increase in **revenue**.
2. The higher **corporate earnings** cause **stock prices** to rise, with the **Dow Jones Industrial Average** increasing by 15% over a six-month period, as seen in the bull market of the 1990s.
3. As **stock prices** increase, investor **confidence** grows, leading to a 20% increase in **investment** in the stock market, with **mutual funds** experiencing a significant influx of new capital.
4. The increased **investment** drives up **stock prices** further, creating a self-reinforcing cycle, where **stock prices** rise by 25% over a one-year period, as experienced during the bull market of the 2000s.
5. The bull market is also driven by **monetary policy**, with the **Federal Reserve** lowering **interest rates** by 1% to stimulate economic growth, as seen in the 2008 financial crisis.
6. The combination of higher **corporate earnings**, increased **investment**, and supportive **monetary policy** leads to a prolonged bull market, with **stock prices** rising by 50% over a three-year period, as experienced during the bull market of the 2010s.

## Key Components
- **Economic growth**: drives higher **corporate earnings** and increased **investment** in the stock market.
- **Monetary policy**: supportive **interest rates** and **inflation** targeting contribute to a bull market.
- **Investor confidence**: increased **investment** and higher **stock prices** reinforce each other.
- **Corporate earnings**: higher **revenue** and **profitability** lead to increased **stock prices**.

## Common Questions
What happens if **interest rates** rise during a bull market? A 1% increase in **interest rates** can slow down the bull market, as higher borrowing costs reduce **investment** and **consumer spending**. 
What is the role of **inflation** in a bull market? **Inflation** targeting by the **Federal Reserve** helps maintain a stable economy, which supports a bull market, as seen in the 1990s when **inflation** was kept below 3% (Bureau of Labor Statistics).
Can a bull market occur without **economic growth**? No, **economic growth** is a necessary condition for a bull market, as it drives higher **corporate earnings** and increased **investment**, as seen in the bull market of the 2010s when **GDP** growth averaged 2.3% (Bureau of Economic Analysis).
