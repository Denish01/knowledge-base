  "content": "There are four primary types of bull markets, categorized based on their underlying drivers and characteristics. \n## Main Categories\n- **Secular Bull Market** \u2014 a long-term bull market driven by strong economic fundamentals, characterized by a prolonged period of low inflation, low interest rates, and high economic growth, as seen in the **US stock market from 1982 to 2000**, which was fueled by the rise of the technology sector and globalization.\n- **Cyclical Bull Market** \u2014 a short-term bull market driven by the business cycle, characterized by a brief period of economic expansion, as exemplified by the **2003-2007 bull run in the US stock market**, which was driven by a recovery in corporate earnings and a decline in interest rates.\n- **Structural Bull Market** \u2014 a bull market driven by significant changes in the economic or market structure, characterized by a shift in the underlying dynamics of the market, as illustrated by the **1980s bull market in Japan**, which was fueled by the country's rapid industrialization and the emergence of its technology sector.\n- **Speculative Bull Market** \u2014 a bull market driven by speculation and investor sentiment, characterized by a rapid increase in asset prices driven by expectations of future price gains, as seen in the **1995-2000 dot-com bubble**, which was fueled by excessive speculation in technology stocks.\n\n## Comparison Table\n| Category | Driver | Duration | Risk |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Secular Bull Market | Strong economic fundamentals | 10-20 years | Low |\n| Cyclical Bull Market | Business cycle | 2-5 years | Medium |\n| Structural Bull Market | Changes in economic or market structure | 5-15 years | Medium |\n| Speculative Bull Market | Speculation and investor sentiment | 1-3 years | High |\n\n## How They Relate\nThe categories are not mutually exclusive, and a bull market can exhibit characteristics of multiple categories. For example, a **secular bull market** can be punctuated by **cyclical bull markets**, as seen in the **US stock market from 1982 to 2000**, which experienced several cyclical bull markets within the broader secular bull market. Similarly, a **structural bull market** can be driven by **speculative** forces, as illustrated by the **1980s bull market in Japan**, which was fueled by both the country's rapid industrialization and excessive speculation. The **US stock market from 2009 to 2020** is another example, which can be characterized as both a **secular bull market**, driven by strong economic fundamentals, and a **speculative bull market**, driven by excessive speculation in certain sectors.",
