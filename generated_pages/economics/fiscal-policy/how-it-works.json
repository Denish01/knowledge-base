  "content": "Fiscal policy is a **government spending** and **taxation** mechanism that influences the overall level of economic activity by adjusting the level of aggregate demand. The core cause-and-effect chain involves the government's fiscal decisions, which affect the money supply, interest rates, and ultimately, economic growth.\n\n## The Mechanism\nThe government's fiscal decisions, such as increasing **government spending** or cutting **taxes**, inject more money into the economy, which increases aggregate demand, and consequently, boosts economic growth. This process is mediated by the **multiplier effect**, where an initial increase in spending or decrease in taxes leads to a larger increase in economic activity, as the initial injection of money is re-spent, creating a ripple effect.\n\n## Step-by-Step\n1. The government decides to increase **government spending** by $100 billion to stimulate economic growth, which is financed by borrowing or printing money, causing the money supply to increase by 2% (Federal Reserve).\n2. As a result, aggregate demand increases by 1.5%, causing businesses to produce more goods and services, and hire more workers, with the **unemployment rate** decreasing by 0.5% (Bureau of Labor Statistics).\n3. The increase in aggregate demand leads to higher **inflation**, with prices rising by 1%, as measured by the **Consumer Price Index (CPI)**, which is calculated and published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n4. To combat inflation, the central bank, such as the Federal Reserve, raises **interest rates** by 0.25% to reduce borrowing and spending, which slows down economic growth, with the **GDP growth rate** decreasing by 0.2% (World Bank).\n5. The higher interest rates also attract foreign investors, causing the exchange rate to appreciate by 5%, making exports more expensive and reducing **net exports** by 1% (International Monetary Fund).\n6. The combination of higher interest rates and reduced net exports leads to a decrease in economic growth, with the **GDP growth rate** slowing down to 2% (World Bank), which is still higher than the initial growth rate before the fiscal policy intervention.\n\n## Key Components\n- **Government spending**: The government's expenditure on goods and services, which injects money into the economy and increases aggregate demand.\n- **Taxation**: The government's revenue collection, which reduces the amount of money available for private spending and investment.\n- **Money supply**: The total amount of money in circulation, which affects interest rates, inflation, and economic growth.\n- **Multiplier effect**: The process by which an initial increase in spending or decrease in taxes leads to a larger increase in economic activity.\n\n## Common Questions\nWhat happens if the government fails to reduce its **budget deficit**? The increasing debt burden will lead to higher **interest rates**, making it more expensive for the government to borrow, and ultimately, reducing its ability to implement fiscal policy effectively. \nWhat is the impact of fiscal policy on **inflation**? Fiscal policy can lead to higher inflation if the increase in aggregate demand outstrips the economy's productive capacity, causing prices to rise. \nHow does fiscal policy affect **unemployment**? Fiscal policy can reduce unemployment by increasing aggregate demand, which leads to higher production and employment, with the **unemployment rate** decreasing by 0.5% (Bureau of Labor Statistics). \nWhat is the relationship between fiscal policy and **exchange rates**? Fiscal policy can affect exchange rates by changing interest rates, which influence the attractiveness of a country's assets to foreign investors, causing the exchange rate to appreciate or depreciate.",
