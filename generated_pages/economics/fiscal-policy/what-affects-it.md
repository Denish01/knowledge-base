# What Affects Fiscal Policy

The single biggest factor affecting fiscal policy is **Government Revenue**, which increases or decreases fiscal policy's effectiveness based on the amount of revenue available, with a notable example being the United States government's revenue of ~$3.5 trillion (US Treasury Department) in 2020, allowing for increased spending on social programs.

## Main Factors
- **Government Revenue** — the amount of revenue available to the government affects fiscal policy's effectiveness, increasing when revenue is high and decreasing when revenue is low, as seen in Norway's sovereign wealth fund, which has accumulated ~$1.2 trillion (Norwegian Government) in revenue from oil exports, enabling the government to maintain a high level of spending despite fluctuations in oil prices.
- **Interest Rates** — changes in interest rates, such as those set by the Federal Reserve using **Monetary Policy**, decrease fiscal policy's effectiveness when high, as increased borrowing costs reduce government spending, and increase when low, as lower borrowing costs enable more spending, with the European Central Bank's setting of a 0% interest rate (European Central Bank) in 2020 resulting in increased government borrowing and spending.
- **Economic Growth** — a growing economy increases fiscal policy's effectiveness by increasing government revenue through higher tax receipts, as seen in China's GDP growth of ~6.1% (World Bank) in 2020, resulting in increased government revenue and spending on infrastructure projects.
- **Inflation** — high inflation decreases fiscal policy's effectiveness by reducing the purchasing power of government spending, as seen in Venezuela's inflation rate of ~10,000% (International Monetary Fund) in 2019, rendering government spending ineffective in stimulating economic growth.
- **Demographic Changes** — changes in population demographics, such as an aging population, affect fiscal policy by increasing spending on social programs, as seen in Japan's aging population, with ~28% (World Bank) of the population over 65, resulting in increased government spending on healthcare and pensions.
- **Global Trade** — changes in global trade policies, such as tariffs and trade agreements, affect fiscal policy by influencing government revenue and spending, as seen in the United States' imposition of a 25% tariff (US Trade Representative) on Chinese goods, resulting in increased government revenue but decreased trade and economic growth.
- **National Debt** — a high national debt decreases fiscal policy's effectiveness by increasing borrowing costs and reducing government flexibility, as seen in Greece's debt-to-GDP ratio of ~180% (European Commission), limiting the government's ability to respond to economic shocks.

## How They Interact
The interaction between **Interest Rates** and **National Debt** amplifies the effect of fiscal policy, as low interest rates enable governments to borrow more and increase spending, but also increase the risk of debt accumulation and reduced fiscal policy effectiveness in the long term, as seen in the United States' increased national debt of ~$27 trillion (US Treasury Department) since 2008. The interaction between **Economic Growth** and **Inflation** also affects fiscal policy, as high economic growth can lead to inflation, reducing the effectiveness of government spending, as seen in Brazil's inflation rate of ~10% (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics) in 2020, despite high economic growth. The interaction between **Government Revenue** and **Demographic Changes** also impacts fiscal policy, as changes in demographics can affect government revenue and spending, as seen in Germany's increased spending on social programs due to an aging population, with ~21% (World Bank) of the population over 65.

## Controllable vs Uncontrollable
The controllable factors affecting fiscal policy include **Government Revenue**, **Interest Rates**, and **National Debt**, which are controlled by governments through taxation, borrowing, and monetary policy, with the Federal Reserve controlling interest rates in the United States. The uncontrollable factors include **Economic Growth**, **Inflation**, **Demographic Changes**, and **Global Trade**, which are influenced by a range of factors, including global economic trends, technological changes, and demographic shifts, with the World Trade Organization influencing global trade policies.
