  "content": "Fiscal policy depends on **accurate economic forecasting**, as incorrect projections can lead to misguided decisions and ineffective policy implementation, such as Japan's failed fiscal expansion in the 1990s, which was based on overly optimistic growth forecasts.\n\n## Key Dependencies\n- **Economic data quality** \u2014 reliable data is necessary for informed decision-making, and its absence can lead to flawed policy, as seen in Argentina's 2001 crisis, where inaccurate GDP estimates contributed to a severe recession.\n- **Political stability** \u2014 a stable government ensures consistent policy implementation, and its lack can disrupt fiscal planning, as experienced in Greece during the 2015 debt crisis, when political instability hindered effective policy response.\n- **Central bank independence** \u2014 an independent central bank allows for effective monetary policy, and its absence can lead to inflation and currency devaluation, as seen in Zimbabwe's 2008 hyperinflation, where political interference in monetary policy exacerbated the crisis.\n- **Fiscal discipline** \u2014 a commitment to responsible spending and borrowing is necessary for sustainable fiscal policy, and its lack can lead to debt crises, such as the 2011 US debt ceiling crisis, where political gridlock threatened the country's credit rating.\n- **International cooperation** \u2014 collaboration with other countries can facilitate global economic stability, and its absence can lead to trade wars and economic downturns, as seen in the 1930s, when protectionist policies exacerbated the Great Depression.\n\n## Priority Order\nThe dependencies can be ranked in order of criticality as follows:\n- **Economic data quality**: accurate data is the foundation of informed decision-making, and its absence can lead to flawed policy.\n- **Political stability**: a stable government ensures consistent policy implementation, and its lack can disrupt fiscal planning.\n- **Central bank independence**: an independent central bank allows for effective monetary policy, and its absence can lead to inflation and currency devaluation.\n- **Fiscal discipline**: a commitment to responsible spending and borrowing is necessary for sustainable fiscal policy, and its lack can lead to debt crises.\n- **International cooperation**: while important, cooperation can be established and strengthened over time, making it slightly less critical than the other dependencies.\n\n## Common Gaps\nOne common assumption is that **fiscal policy can be effective in isolation**, without considering the impact of monetary policy or external economic factors, which can lead to unintended consequences, such as the 2013 US taper tantrum, where monetary policy tightening led to emerging market currency crises, highlighting the need for coordinated policy responses.",
