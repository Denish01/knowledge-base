# What Affects Monopoly

Government regulations are the single biggest factor affecting **monopoly**, as they can either increase or decrease market concentration by imposing barriers to entry or exit, with Boeing's 60% market share in commercial aircraft (Teal Group) being a notable example of a regulated monopoly.

## Main Factors
- **Barriers to entry** — high startup costs, such as initial investments in research and development, can increase monopoly by limiting the number of potential competitors, as seen in the pharmaceutical industry where Pfizer spent $7.7 billion on research and development in 2020 (Pfizer annual report), resulting in a significant increase in market share.
- **Economies of scale** — larger firms can decrease costs per unit, increasing their competitiveness and leading to a decrease in the number of smaller firms, as demonstrated by Amazon's ability to offer lower prices due to its massive scale, with a net sales revenue of $386 billion in 2020 (Amazon annual report).
- **Network effects** — the value of a product or service increases with the number of users, which can increase monopoly by creating a self-reinforcing cycle, as seen in the case of Facebook, which has 2.7 billion monthly active users (Facebook annual report), making it more attractive to new users and advertisers.
- **Government subsidies** — financial support from the government can increase monopoly by giving a competitive advantage to the subsidized firm, as exemplified by the $15 billion in subsidies received by Boeing from the US government between 1995 and 2018 (Good Jobs First), allowing it to maintain its market dominance.
- **Patent protection** — exclusive rights to intellectual property can increase monopoly by preventing other firms from producing similar products, as seen in the case of Apple's iPhone, which has a large portfolio of patents (US Patent and Trademark Office), resulting in a significant increase in market share.
- **Market demand** — changes in consumer preferences and demand can decrease monopoly by creating opportunities for new firms to enter the market, as demonstrated by the rise of plant-based meat alternatives, with sales increasing by 20% in 2020 (Good Food Institute), leading to a decrease in the market share of traditional meat producers.
- **Technological advancements** — innovations can decrease monopoly by reducing barriers to entry and creating new opportunities for firms to compete, as seen in the case of 3D printing, which has reduced production costs and enabled new firms to enter the market, with the global 3D printing market expected to reach $44.5 billion by 2025 (MarketsandMarkets).

## How They Interact
The interaction between **barriers to entry** and **economies of scale** can amplify the effect of monopoly, as high startup costs can limit the number of competitors, allowing larger firms to further decrease their costs and increase their market share, as seen in the case of Amazon, which has used its massive scale to offer lower prices and expand its market dominance. On the other hand, the interaction between **network effects** and **government subsidies** can also amplify the effect of monopoly, as subsidies can increase the attractiveness of a product or service, creating a self-reinforcing cycle that further increases market share, as demonstrated by the case of Boeing, which has received significant subsidies from the US government and has a large market share in the commercial aircraft industry.

## Controllable vs Uncontrollable
The factors affecting monopoly can be split into two groups: controllable and uncontrollable. Controllable factors include **government regulations**, **government subsidies**, and **patent protection**, which are controlled by governments and regulatory bodies. For example, governments can impose stricter regulations on mergers and acquisitions to limit market concentration, or they can provide subsidies to support new firms and increase competition. Uncontrollable factors include **economies of scale**, **network effects**, **market demand**, and **technological advancements**, which are driven by market forces and consumer preferences. While firms can respond to these factors by adjusting their strategies and investments, they cannot directly control them.
