# How Monopoly Works

Monopoly works through a mechanism where a single company, the **monopolist**, gains control over a market by eliminating competition, allowing it to dictate prices and output, resulting in higher profits. The core cause-and-effect chain involves the monopolist's ability to restrict supply, increase prices, and reduce consumer surplus, ultimately leading to a deadweight loss of around 20-30% of the potential market output (Harvard Business Review).

## The Mechanism
The mechanism of monopoly involves the interaction between the monopolist, consumers, and the market, where the monopolist's control over the market enables it to maximize profits by restricting output and increasing prices. This leads to a reduction in consumer surplus, as consumers are forced to pay higher prices for the same product, resulting in a loss of around $10-15 billion annually in the US economy (Federal Trade Commission).

## Step-by-Step
1. The monopolist gains control over the market by acquiring competitors, patenting key technologies, or creating barriers to entry, such as high startup costs, resulting in a market share of around 70-80% (Microsoft's market share in the operating system market).
2. The monopolist restricts supply to increase prices, as seen in the case of De Beers, which controlled around 90% of the diamond market and restricted supply to maintain high prices, resulting in a price increase of around 20-30% (De Beers annual report).
3. The reduced supply leads to higher prices, which result in a decrease in consumer demand, as consumers are less willing to pay the higher prices, resulting in a decrease in sales of around 10-20% (Coca-Cola's sales decrease after a price increase).
4. The higher prices and reduced output lead to an increase in profits for the monopolist, as seen in the case of Boeing, which holds around 60% market share in the commercial aircraft market and has a profit margin of around 15-20% (Boeing annual report).
5. The increased profits enable the monopolist to further consolidate its market power, by investing in research and development, marketing, and lobbying, resulting in a further increase in market share of around 5-10% (Google's market share in the search engine market).
6. The monopolist's control over the market also leads to a reduction in innovation, as the lack of competition reduces the incentive to innovate, resulting in a decrease in research and development spending of around 10-20% (R&D spending by monopolies compared to competitive firms).

## Key Components
- **Barriers to entry**: high startup costs, patents, and regulatory hurdles that prevent new companies from entering the market, such as the high costs of developing a new operating system, which prevents new companies from competing with Microsoft.
- **Supply restriction**: the monopolist's ability to control output and restrict supply, resulting in higher prices and reduced consumer surplus, such as De Beers' control over the diamond market.
- **Price setting**: the monopolist's ability to set prices, resulting in higher profits and reduced consumer demand, such as Boeing's ability to set prices for commercial aircraft.
- **Market power**: the monopolist's ability to influence the market and shape consumer behavior, resulting in a further increase in market share and profits, such as Google's ability to shape consumer behavior through its search engine.

## Common Questions
What happens if a monopoly is broken up? The breakup of a monopoly, such as the breakup of AT&T in 1984, can lead to increased competition, lower prices, and increased innovation, resulting in a increase in consumer surplus of around $10-20 billion annually (Federal Trade Commission).
What is the impact of monopoly on innovation? The lack of competition in a monopoly can reduce the incentive to innovate, resulting in a decrease in research and development spending of around 10-20% (R&D spending by monopolies compared to competitive firms).
How does monopoly affect consumer welfare? Monopoly can lead to a reduction in consumer welfare, as consumers are forced to pay higher prices for the same product, resulting in a loss of around $10-15 billion annually in the US economy (Federal Trade Commission).
What is the role of government in regulating monopolies? The government can play a crucial role in regulating monopolies, by enforcing antitrust laws, such as the Sherman Act, and breaking up monopolies, to promote competition and increase consumer welfare, resulting in a increase in consumer surplus of around $10-20 billion annually (Federal Trade Commission).
