# Example of Monopoly

## Definition
Monopoly is a market structure where a single firm, **Boeing** or **Microsoft** for instance, supplies the entire market with a particular good or service, a concept first identified by **Adam Smith** in 1776.

## How It Works
A monopoly arises when a firm has complete control over the supply of a particular good or service, allowing it to influence the market price. This can occur through **barriers to entry**, such as high startup costs or government regulations, which prevent other firms from entering the market. For example, **Boeing** produces ~800 aircraft annually (Boeing annual report), giving it significant control over the global aircraft market. According to **Ricardo's comparative advantage model**, 1817, a monopoly can also arise when a firm has a significant cost advantage over its competitors, allowing it to undercut their prices and drive them out of the market.

The mechanisms of a monopoly can be seen in the way **Microsoft** dominates the operating system market, with its **Windows** operating system installed on over 80% of the world's computers (NetMarketShare). This allows **Microsoft** to set the price of its operating system, as well as influence the development of software applications that run on it. The **monopoly power** of a firm like **Microsoft** can also lead to **rent-seeking behavior**, where the firm uses its market power to extract excess profits from consumers, rather than investing in innovation or improving its products.

The impact of a monopoly on the market can be significant, with **deadweight loss** occurring when the monopolist restricts output to drive up prices, leading to a loss of economic efficiency. According to **Pigou's theory of monopoly**, 1908, the deadweight loss of a monopoly can be measured by the area under the demand curve and above the marginal cost curve. For example, the **US airline industry** is characterized by a high level of concentration, with the four largest carriers controlling over 80% of the market (DOT), leading to higher prices and reduced competition.

## Key Components
- **Barriers to entry**: high startup costs, government regulations, or other obstacles that prevent new firms from entering the market, allowing the monopolist to maintain its market power.
- **Monopoly power**: the ability of a firm to influence the market price of a good or service, allowing it to extract excess profits from consumers.
- **Rent-seeking behavior**: the tendency of a monopolist to use its market power to extract excess profits from consumers, rather than investing in innovation or improving its products.
- **Deadweight loss**: the loss of economic efficiency that occurs when a monopolist restricts output to drive up prices, leading to a reduction in consumer surplus.
- **Price elasticity of demand**: the responsiveness of consumers to changes in the price of a good or service, which can affect the monopolist's ability to set prices and extract profits.
- **Substitutes**: alternative goods or services that can replace the monopolist's product, which can limit its market power and influence its pricing decisions.

## Common Misconceptions
**Myth:** Monopolies are always bad for consumers — **Fact:** While monopolies can lead to higher prices and reduced competition, they can also drive innovation and investment in research and development, as seen in the case of **Google**'s dominance in the search engine market (ComScore).
**Myth:** Monopolies are always the result of government intervention — **Fact:** Monopolies can arise naturally through **comparative advantage**, as seen in the case of **Saudi Arabia**'s dominance in the global oil market (OPEC).
**Myth:** Monopolies are always characterized by high prices and low output — **Fact:** Monopolies can also lead to low prices and high output, as seen in the case of **Walmart**'s dominance in the US retail market (Walmart annual report).
**Myth:** Monopolies are always permanent — **Fact:** Monopolies can be temporary, as seen in the case of **Apple**'s dominance in the smartphone market, which has been challenged by **Samsung** and other competitors (IDC).

## In Practice
The **US telecommunications industry** is a prime example of a monopoly in practice, with **AT&T**, **Verizon**, and **T-Mobile** controlling over 90% of the market (FCC). These firms have significant market power, allowing them to set prices and influence the development of new technologies, such as **5G** networks. According to **Harvard University**'s **National Bureau of Economic Research**, the US telecommunications industry is characterized by high levels of concentration and barriers to entry, leading to reduced competition and higher prices for consumers (NBER). The **Federal Communications Commission** (FCC) has implemented regulations to promote competition and reduce the market power of these firms, such as **net neutrality** rules and **spectrum auctions** (FCC).
