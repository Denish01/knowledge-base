# Monopoly Compared

## Definition
Monopoly Compared is a framework used to analyze the competitive landscape of industries by comparing the market share and pricing power of dominant companies, originating from the work of economist **John Hicks**.

## How It Works
The Monopoly Compared framework examines the degree of market concentration and the resulting impact on prices and profits. According to **Ricardo's comparative advantage model**, companies with larger market shares can negotiate better prices with suppliers and exert significant influence on the overall market price. For instance, Boeing produces ~800 aircraft annually (Boeing annual report) and holds 60% market share (Teal Group), giving it substantial bargaining power with suppliers like General Electric. This, in turn, allows Boeing to maintain higher profit margins compared to its competitors.

The framework also considers the concept of **barriers to entry**, which prevent new companies from entering the market and competing with established players. In the aircraft manufacturing industry, high development costs and strict regulatory requirements create significant barriers to entry, limiting the number of new competitors and allowing dominant companies like Boeing and Airbus to maintain their market share. The **Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI)**, a measure of market concentration, is often used to quantify the level of competition in an industry. For example, the HHI for the US airline industry is around 1200 (US Department of Justice), indicating a moderately concentrated market.

The Monopoly Compared framework can be applied to various industries, including technology and finance. In the tech industry, companies like **Google** and **Amazon** have significant market shares in their respective domains, allowing them to exert influence over the market and maintain high profit margins. Google's market share in the search engine market is around 87% (StatCounter), giving it substantial advertising revenue and allowing it to invest in new technologies and expand its product offerings.

## Key Components
- **Market share**: The proportion of the market controlled by a company, which determines its pricing power and influence over the market. An increase in market share can lead to higher profits and greater bargaining power with suppliers.
- **Barriers to entry**: The obstacles that prevent new companies from entering the market, such as high development costs or regulatory requirements. An increase in barriers to entry can limit competition and allow dominant companies to maintain their market share.
- **Pricing power**: The ability of a company to set prices without losing market share, which is influenced by its market share and the level of competition in the industry. An increase in pricing power can lead to higher profit margins.
- **Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI)**: A measure of market concentration, which is used to quantify the level of competition in an industry. A higher HHI indicates a more concentrated market.
- **Comparative advantage**: The idea that companies can gain a competitive advantage by specializing in areas where they have a relative advantage, according to **Ricardo's comparative advantage model**. An increase in comparative advantage can lead to higher productivity and lower costs.
- **Regulatory requirements**: The rules and regulations that govern an industry, which can create barriers to entry and influence the competitive landscape. An increase in regulatory requirements can limit competition and allow dominant companies to maintain their market share.

## Common Misconceptions
**Myth:** Monopoly Compared is only applicable to industries with a single dominant company. **Fact:** The framework can be applied to industries with multiple dominant companies, such as the aircraft manufacturing industry, where Boeing and Airbus are both major players.
**Myth:** Market share is the only factor that determines a company's pricing power. **Fact:** Other factors, such as barriers to entry and regulatory requirements, also influence a company's pricing power, as seen in the tech industry where companies like Google and Amazon have significant market shares but also face regulatory scrutiny.
**Myth:** The Monopoly Compared framework is only relevant to large companies. **Fact:** The framework can be applied to companies of all sizes, as smaller companies can also exert influence over their respective markets, such as **SAP** in the enterprise software market, which has a market share of around 24% (Gartner).
**Myth:** The framework is only used to analyze industries with high market concentration. **Fact:** The Monopoly Compared framework can be used to analyze industries with varying levels of market concentration, such as the US airline industry, which has a moderately concentrated market.

## In Practice
In the US airline industry, the Monopoly Compared framework can be used to analyze the competitive landscape and the resulting impact on prices and profits. For example, **American Airlines** has a market share of around 19% (US Department of Transportation), while **Delta Air Lines** has a market share of around 17% (US Department of Transportation). The HHI for the US airline industry is around 1200 (US Department of Justice), indicating a moderately concentrated market. By applying the Monopoly Compared framework, we can see that the industry's market concentration and the resulting pricing power of dominant companies like American Airlines and Delta Air Lines have a significant impact on the industry's profitability. In 2020, the US airline industry generated revenues of around $247 billion (US Department of Transportation) and net profits of around $14 billion (US Department of Transportation), demonstrating the significant influence of market share and pricing power on industry performance.
