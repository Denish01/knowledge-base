# What Is Monopoly?

## Definition
Monopoly is a market structure where a single firm, **monopolist**, supplies the entire market with a particular good or service, a concept first identified by Cournot in 1838.

## How It Works
A monopolist has the power to influence the market price of its product by adjusting the quantity supplied, as it is the sole supplier. The **monopoly power** allows the firm to restrict output and increase price, resulting in a higher profit margin. According to Ricardo's comparative advantage model, 1817, a monopolist can maintain its market power by limiting competition, often through barriers to entry such as high startup costs or government regulations. For instance, Boeing produces ~800 aircraft annually (Boeing annual report), giving it significant market power in the commercial aircraft industry.

The **barriers to entry** that prevent new firms from entering the market can be natural, such as high fixed costs, or artificial, such as government-issued patents or licenses. In the case of a **natural monopoly**, the market is characterized by decreasing average costs, making it more efficient for a single firm to supply the entire market. The monopolist can then use its market power to set a higher price, reducing consumer surplus. The Lerner index, developed by Lerner in 1934, measures the degree of monopoly power by calculating the difference between price and marginal cost, divided by price.

Monopoly power can also be maintained through **price discrimination**, where the monopolist charges different prices to different consumers based on their willingness to pay. This practice allows the monopolist to capture a larger share of the consumer surplus, increasing its profit. The **deadweight loss**, a concept developed by Marshall in 1890, refers to the loss of economic efficiency caused by the monopolist's restriction of output, resulting in a decrease in social welfare.

## Key Components
- **Market power**: the ability of the monopolist to influence the market price by adjusting the quantity supplied, allowing it to restrict output and increase price.
- **Barriers to entry**: obstacles that prevent new firms from entering the market, such as high startup costs or government regulations, which help maintain the monopolist's market power.
- **Monopoly profit**: the excess profit earned by the monopolist due to its market power, which is higher than the profit that would be earned in a competitive market.
- **Consumer surplus**: the difference between the maximum price consumers are willing to pay and the actual price they pay, which is reduced by the monopolist's price-setting.
- **Deadweight loss**: the loss of economic efficiency caused by the monopolist's restriction of output, resulting in a decrease in social welfare.
- **Price elasticity of demand**: the responsiveness of consumers to changes in price, which affects the monopolist's ability to set a higher price and maintain its market power.

## Common Misconceptions
**Myth:** Monopoly always leads to higher prices — **Fact:** While a monopolist can set a higher price, the actual price may be lower than in a competitive market if the monopolist is more efficient, as seen in the case of Boeing's economies of scale (Boeing annual report).
**Myth:** All monopolies are created by government intervention — **Fact:** Natural monopolies can arise due to decreasing average costs, such as in the case of utility companies, which can supply the entire market more efficiently than multiple firms.
**Myth:** Monopoly always reduces economic efficiency — **Fact:** In some cases, a monopolist can increase economic efficiency by reducing costs and improving quality, such as through investment in research and development, as seen in the case of pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer.

## In Practice
In the United States, the **Federal Trade Commission (FTC)** regulates monopolies and enforces antitrust laws to promote competition. For example, in 2001, the FTC blocked a proposed merger between General Electric and Honeywell, citing concerns about reduced competition in the aircraft engine market. The merger would have given the combined company significant market power, potentially leading to higher prices and reduced innovation. The FTC's decision was based on the principles of **antitrust economics**, which aim to promote competition and protect consumer welfare.
