# Types of Monopoly

There are four main categories of monopoly, organized by the source of their market power: **natural monopoly**, **government-granted monopoly**, **barriers-to-entry monopoly**, and **technological monopoly**. 

## Main Categories
- **Natural Monopoly** — a market structure where a single firm can supply the entire market at a lower cost than multiple firms, distinguished by high fixed costs and low marginal costs, as seen in the case of **Pacific Gas and Electric Company**, which provides electricity to much of Northern California.
- **Government-Granted Monopoly** — a market structure where the government grants a single firm the exclusive right to provide a good or service, often in exchange for a fee or other consideration, as seen in the case of **De Beers**, which was granted a monopoly over the diamond market in South Africa by the government.
- **Barriers-to-Entry Monopoly** — a market structure where a single firm has erected barriers to prevent other firms from entering the market, such as through strategic acquisitions or **patent protection**, as seen in the case of **Microsoft**, which used its control over the Windows operating system to limit competition in the software market.
- **Technological Monopoly** — a market structure where a single firm has developed a proprietary technology that gives it a significant advantage over its competitors, such as **Google's search algorithm**, which allows it to dominate the search engine market.

## Comparison Table
| Category | Source of Market Power | Example | Duration of Monopoly |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Natural Monopoly | High fixed costs, low marginal costs | Pacific Gas and Electric Company | Indefinite |
| Government-Granted Monopoly | Government grant | De Beers | Until government revokes grant |
| Barriers-to-Entry Monopoly | Strategic acquisitions, patent protection | Microsoft | Until barriers are breached |
| Technological Monopoly | Proprietary technology | Google | Until technology becomes obsolete |

## How They Relate
The categories of monopoly are not mutually exclusive, and firms may hold multiple types of monopoly power simultaneously. For example, a firm with a **technological monopoly** may also erect **barriers to entry** to prevent other firms from developing similar technologies. **Government-granted monopolies** may also be **natural monopolies**, as in the case of a utility company that is granted a monopoly over a particular market due to its high fixed costs and low marginal costs. Specific pairs of categories, such as **natural monopoly** and **government-granted monopoly**, are commonly confused, but can be distinguished by the source of the firm's market power. **Barriers-to-entry monopoly** and **technological monopoly** may also overlap, as a firm with a proprietary technology may use that technology to erect barriers to entry and prevent other firms from competing.
