# What Is Market Equilibrium?

## Definition
Market equilibrium is a state where the supply of a product or service equals the demand for it, a concept first introduced by Léon Walras in 1874.

## How It Works
The **law of supply** and **law of demand** are the two primary mechanisms driving market equilibrium. The law of supply states that as the price of a product increases, the quantity supplied also increases, as producers are incentivized to produce more. Conversely, the law of demand states that as the price of a product increases, the quantity demanded decreases, as consumers are less willing to buy. According to Ricardo's comparative advantage model, 1817, countries should specialize in producing goods for which they have a lower opportunity cost, leading to more efficient production and trade. For instance, Boeing produces ~800 aircraft annually (Boeing annual report), and the demand for these aircraft is influenced by factors such as fuel prices, airline profits, and global economic conditions.

The supply and demand curves intersect at a point known as the equilibrium price and quantity. This equilibrium is not always stable, as changes in supply and demand can cause the market to shift. For example, a drought in Brazil can decrease the global supply of coffee, causing the price to rise and the quantity demanded to fall. The **cobweb model**, developed by Nicholas Kaldor, 1934, illustrates how supply and demand can oscillate around the equilibrium point, leading to fluctuations in price and quantity. The model shows that if the supply curve is steeper than the demand curve, the market will converge to equilibrium, but if the demand curve is steeper, the market will diverge.

The **price elasticity of demand** also plays a crucial part in determining market equilibrium. If the demand for a product is highly elastic, a small increase in price will lead to a large decrease in quantity demanded, causing the market to shift away from equilibrium. On the other hand, if the demand is inelastic, a large increase in price will lead to only a small decrease in quantity demanded, causing the market to remain closer to equilibrium. For example, the demand for insulin is relatively inelastic, as diabetic patients require a constant supply, regardless of price increases.

## Key Components
- **Supply curve**: shows the relationship between the price of a product and the quantity supplied, with the curve typically sloping upward as higher prices incentivize producers to produce more.
- **Demand curve**: shows the relationship between the price of a product and the quantity demanded, with the curve typically sloping downward as higher prices discourage consumers from buying.
- **Equilibrium price**: the price at which the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded, and the market is in a state of equilibrium.
- **Equilibrium quantity**: the quantity at which the supply and demand curves intersect, and the market is in a state of equilibrium.
- **Subsidies**: government payments to producers or consumers that can shift the supply or demand curve, affecting market equilibrium.
- **Taxes**: government levies on producers or consumers that can also shift the supply or demand curve, affecting market equilibrium.

## Common Misconceptions
**Myth:** Market equilibrium is always stable — **Fact:** Market equilibrium can be unstable, as changes in supply and demand can cause the market to shift, as illustrated by the cobweb model (Kaldor, 1934).
**Myth:** The law of supply and demand only applies to individual markets — **Fact:** The law of supply and demand applies to all markets, including aggregate markets, as demonstrated by the **IS-LM model** (Hicks, 1937).
**Myth:** Government intervention always disrupts market equilibrium — **Fact:** Government intervention, such as subsidies or taxes, can sometimes be used to correct market failures and achieve a more efficient equilibrium, as shown by the **theory of second best** (Lipsey and Lancaster, 1956).

## In Practice
In the United States, the market for wheat is subject to fluctuations in supply and demand. According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), the country produces approximately 1.9 billion bushels of wheat annually, with the majority being exported to countries such as Japan and Mexico. The demand for wheat is influenced by factors such as global food prices, weather conditions, and government policies. For instance, the 2019 tariffs imposed by the United States on Chinese goods led to a decrease in Chinese imports of American wheat, causing the price to fall and the quantity supplied to increase. The USDA reported that the 2019 wheat crop was valued at approximately $10.2 billion, highlighting the significant economic impact of market equilibrium on the agricultural sector.
