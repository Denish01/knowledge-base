# What Market Equilibrium Depends On

Market equilibrium depends on **Supply and Demand Balance**, as an imbalance between the two can lead to market inefficiencies, such as surpluses or shortages, as seen in the 1970s oil embargo, where a supply shortage led to significant price increases.

## Key Dependencies
- **Supply and Demand Balance** — required to determine market equilibrium price and quantity, as an imbalance can lead to market inefficiencies, such as the 1970s oil embargo, where a supply shortage led to significant price increases.
- **Consumer Preferences** — necessary to understand demand, as changes in consumer preferences can shift demand curves, as seen in the decline of tobacco sales due to increased health awareness.
- **Production Costs** — essential to determine supply, as changes in production costs can shift supply curves, such as the increase in coffee prices due to droughts in major coffee-producing countries.
- **Government Policies** — influence market equilibrium through taxes, subsidies, and regulations, as seen in the sugar industry, where government subsidies have led to overproduction and market distortions.
- **Technological Advancements** — can increase efficiency and reduce production costs, leading to changes in supply, as seen in the shale oil revolution, which increased oil production and reduced prices.
- **Market Information** — necessary for buyers and sellers to make informed decisions, as lack of information can lead to market failures, such as the 2008 housing market crisis, where inadequate information led to subprime lending and subsequent market collapse.

## Priority Order
The dependencies can be ranked in the following order:
- **Supply and Demand Balance**, as it is the most critical factor in determining market equilibrium.
- **Consumer Preferences**, as changes in consumer preferences can significantly impact demand and, in turn, market equilibrium.
- **Production Costs**, as changes in production costs can shift supply curves and impact market equilibrium.
- **Government Policies**, as they can influence market equilibrium through various means, but their impact can be mitigated through other factors.
- **Technological Advancements**, as they can increase efficiency and reduce production costs, but their impact may be slower and more gradual.
- **Market Information**, as while it is necessary for informed decision-making, its absence can be mitigated through other means, such as market research and analysis.

## Common Gaps
People often overlook the impact of **Externalities**, such as environmental and social costs, which can lead to market failures and inefficiencies, as seen in the case of climate change, where the absence of pricing carbon emissions has led to significant externalities and market distortions. Another common gap is the assumption of **Perfect Competition**, which can lead to market failures and inefficiencies, as seen in the case of monopolies and oligopolies, where firms can exert significant market power and influence prices.
