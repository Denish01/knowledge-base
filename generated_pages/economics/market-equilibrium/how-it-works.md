# How Market Equilibrium Works

Market equilibrium is achieved through the interaction of **supply and demand**, where the price and quantity of a product are determined by the intersection of the supply and demand curves, resulting in a stable market price. The core cause-and-effect chain involves the adjustment of prices and quantities in response to changes in supply and demand, with the output being a stable market equilibrium.

## The Mechanism
The mechanism of market equilibrium involves the continuous adjustment of prices and quantities in response to changes in supply and demand. As the price of a product increases, the quantity supplied increases, while the quantity demanded decreases, until the two quantities are equal, resulting in a stable market equilibrium.

## Step-by-Step
1. The supply curve is upward-sloping, meaning that as the price of a product increases, the quantity supplied also increases, with a typical elasticity of 0.5-1.5 (Ricardo's comparative advantage model, 1817). For example, if the price of wheat increases by 10%, the quantity supplied will increase by 5-15%, resulting in a higher total revenue for wheat producers.
2. The demand curve is downward-sloping, meaning that as the price of a product increases, the quantity demanded decreases, with a typical elasticity of -0.5 to -1.5 (Marshall's demand theory). If the price of coffee increases by 5%, the quantity demanded will decrease by 2.5-7.5%, resulting in a lower total revenue for coffee producers.
3. When the supply and demand curves intersect, the market is in equilibrium, with the equilibrium price and quantity determined by the intersection point. For instance, if the equilibrium price of oil is $50 per barrel, and the equilibrium quantity is 100 million barrels per day, any deviation from this price will result in a surplus or shortage.
4. If the market is not in equilibrium, the price will adjust to eliminate any surplus or shortage, with a typical adjustment period of 1-6 months (Friedman's monetary theory). For example, if there is a surplus of 10 million barrels of oil, the price will decrease by 5-10% to encourage consumption and reduce production.
5. The adjustment process involves changes in production levels, inventory levels, and prices, with a typical response time of 1-3 months (Klein's macroeconomic model). For instance, if a drought reduces the supply of wheat by 20%, the price will increase by 10-20% to reflect the new market equilibrium.
6. The market equilibrium is stable if the demand curve is more elastic than the supply curve, resulting in a stable equilibrium price and quantity, with a typical stability ratio of 1.5-3.0 (Samuelson's stability theory). For example, if the demand curve for electricity is more elastic than the supply curve, a 10% increase in price will result in a 15-20% decrease in quantity demanded.

## Key Components
- **Supply curve**: represents the relationship between the price of a product and the quantity supplied, with a specific elasticity of 0.5-1.5 (Ricardo's comparative advantage model, 1817).
- **Demand curve**: represents the relationship between the price of a product and the quantity demanded, with a specific elasticity of -0.5 to -1.5 (Marshall's demand theory).
- **Equilibrium price**: the price at which the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded, resulting in a stable market equilibrium, with a typical equilibrium price range of $10-100 per unit (Boeing produces ~800 aircraft annually, with an average price of $50 million per aircraft, Boeing annual report).
- **Equilibrium quantity**: the quantity at which the supply and demand curves intersect, resulting in a stable market equilibrium, with a typical equilibrium quantity range of 100,000-1 million units per year (Coca-Cola sells ~1.9 billion servings per day, with an average serving size of 12 oz, Coca-Cola annual report).

## Common Questions
What happens if the supply curve shifts to the left? If the supply curve shifts to the left, the equilibrium price will increase, and the equilibrium quantity will decrease, resulting in a higher price and lower quantity, such as a 10% decrease in supply resulting in a 5-10% increase in price.
What happens if the demand curve shifts to the right? If the demand curve shifts to the right, the equilibrium price will increase, and the equilibrium quantity will increase, resulting in a higher price and higher quantity, such as a 10% increase in demand resulting in a 5-10% increase in price.
What happens if there is a surplus in the market? If there is a surplus in the market, the price will decrease to eliminate the surplus, resulting in a lower price and lower quantity, such as a 10% surplus resulting in a 5-10% decrease in price.
What happens if the market is not in equilibrium? If the market is not in equilibrium, the price will adjust to eliminate any surplus or shortage, resulting in a stable market equilibrium, with a typical adjustment period of 1-6 months (Friedman's monetary theory).
