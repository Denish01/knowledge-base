# What Is Nitrogen Cycle?

Nitrogen cycle refers to the process by which nitrogen is converted between its various forms in the environment, including the atmosphere, soil, water, and living organisms.

The nitrogen cycle is an essential process that supports life on Earth. Nitrogen is a vital nutrient for plants and animals, and it is a key component of amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins. However, the atmosphere is mostly composed of nitrogen gas, which is not usable by most living organisms. To become available to plants and animals, nitrogen must be converted into other forms, such as ammonia or nitrate, through a series of chemical reactions.

These chemical reactions involve various microorganisms, including bacteria and archaea, that live in soil, water, and the digestive systems of animals. Some microorganisms, such as those in the soil, convert nitrogen gas into ammonia, a process known as nitrogen fixation. Other microorganisms, such as those in the ocean, convert ammonia into nitrite and then into nitrate, which can be used by plants. Plants absorb nitrate from the soil and use it to build proteins, which are then consumed by animals.

As animals consume plants and other animals, they use the nitrogen from these proteins to build their own tissues. When animals excrete waste or die, the nitrogen is released back into the environment, where it can be converted into other forms and reused by other living organisms. This continuous cycle of nitrogen conversion is essential for maintaining the balance of nutrients in ecosystems and supporting the diversity of life on Earth.

The key components of the nitrogen cycle include:
* Nitrogen fixation, the process by which nitrogen gas is converted into ammonia
* Ammonification, the process by which organic matter is broken down into ammonia
* Nitrification, the process by which ammonia is converted into nitrite and then into nitrate
* Denitrification, the process by which nitrate is converted back into nitrogen gas
* Assimilation, the process by which plants and animals use nitrogen to build proteins and other tissues
* Decomposition, the process by which dead organisms are broken down and their nutrients, including nitrogen, are released back into the environment

Despite its importance, the nitrogen cycle is often misunderstood. Some common misconceptions about the nitrogen cycle include:
* That nitrogen is not an essential nutrient for plants and animals
* That the nitrogen cycle only occurs in soil and not in other environments, such as the ocean
* That human activities, such as farming and industrial processes, do not impact the nitrogen cycle
* That the nitrogen cycle is a simple, linear process, rather than a complex, circular one

A real-world example of the nitrogen cycle can be seen in a cornfield. Corn plants absorb nitrate from the soil and use it to build proteins, which are then harvested by humans. However, the nitrate in the soil is not replenished naturally, so farmers must add fertilizers, which contain nitrogen, to the soil to support plant growth. As the corn plants grow, they absorb the nitrogen from the fertilizers, and when they are harvested, the nitrogen is removed from the field. To replenish the nitrogen in the soil, farmers may plant legumes, such as soybeans or beans, which have microorganisms in their roots that fix nitrogen from the atmosphere, converting it into a form that can be used by other plants.

The nitrogen cycle is a complex, circular process that involves the conversion of nitrogen between its various forms in the environment, supporting the balance of nutrients in ecosystems and the diversity of life on Earth.
