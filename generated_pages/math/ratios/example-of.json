  "content": "1. INTRODUCTION\nA ratio is a way to compare two quantities by dividing one by the other. It is often expressed as a fraction, with the first quantity as the numerator and the second quantity as the denominator. Ratios can be used to describe a wide range of phenomena, from the proportions of ingredients in a recipe to the scale of a map. Understanding ratios is essential for solving problems in various fields, including mathematics, science, and engineering.\n\n2. EVERYDAY EXAMPLES\nRatios are used in many everyday situations. For example, a recipe for making cookies might call for a ratio of 2:1 of flour to sugar. This means that for every 2 cups of flour, 1 cup of sugar is needed. Another example is the ratio of water to fertilizer in a garden, which might be 10:1. This means that for every 10 gallons of water, 1 gallon of fertilizer is added. In construction, the ratio of cement to sand in concrete might be 1:3, meaning that for every 1 bag of cement, 3 bags of sand are used. Additionally, the ratio of students to teachers in a classroom might be 20:1, indicating that there are 20 students for every 1 teacher.\n\n3. NOTABLE EXAMPLES\nThere are many well-known examples of ratios. The golden ratio, often represented by the Greek letter phi, is approximately equal to 1.618:1. This ratio has been observed in many natural and artistic patterns, including the arrangement of leaves on a stem and the design of the Parthenon in Greece. Another example is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, which is approximately 3.14:1. This ratio is known as pi and is a fundamental constant in mathematics. The aspect ratio of a television screen, which is typically 16:9, is also a notable example of a ratio.\n\n4. EDGE CASES\nRatios can also be used to describe unusual or complex phenomena. For example, the ratio of the mass of a proton to the mass of an electron is approximately 1836:1. This means that a proton is about 1836 times more massive than an electron. Another example is the ratio of the distance between the Earth and the Sun to the distance between the Earth and the Moon, which is approximately 389:1. This means that the Sun is about 389 times farther away from the Earth than the Moon is.\n\n5. NON-EXAMPLES\nSome people may confuse other mathematical concepts with ratios. For example, a percentage is not a ratio, although it can be expressed as a ratio. A percentage is a way to express a proportion as a fraction of 100. For instance, 25% can be expressed as the ratio 25:100, but the percentage itself is not a ratio. Another example is a difference, which is a way to compare two quantities by subtracting one from the other. For instance, the difference between 10 and 5 is 5, but this is not a ratio. A proportion is also sometimes confused with a ratio, but a proportion is an equation that states that two ratios are equal, such as 2:3 = 4:6.\n\n6. PATTERN\nAll valid examples of ratios have one thing in common: they compare two quantities by dividing one by the other. Whether it is a simple recipe, a complex scientific phenomenon, or a mathematical constant, ratios provide a way to describe and analyze the relationships between different quantities. By expressing these relationships as fractions or proportions, ratios allow us to make predictions, solve problems, and understand the world around us. The key characteristic of a ratio is that it describes a comparative relationship between two quantities, and this relationship can be expressed as a fraction or a proportion. This pattern holds true across all the examples of ratios, from the simplest everyday situations to the most complex scientific phenomena.",
