# Common Misconceptions About Order Of Operations

1. INTRODUCTION:
The order of operations is a fundamental concept in mathematics that helps individuals simplify expressions and solve equations. However, misconceptions about the order of operations are common, even among students who have received proper instruction. These misconceptions can lead to errors in calculation and problem-solving. One reason for these misconceptions is the lack of understanding of the underlying rules and principles. Additionally, the order of operations can be confusing, especially when dealing with complex expressions and equations. In this article, we will explore common misconceptions about the order of operations, examine the reality behind these myths, and provide tips on how to remember the correct order.

2. MISCONCEPTION LIST:
- Myth: The order of operations is only applicable to simple expressions.
Reality: The order of operations applies to all mathematical expressions, regardless of their complexity.
Why people believe this: Many people believe that the order of operations is only necessary for simple expressions, such as 2 + 3 * 4. However, this is not the case, as the order of operations is essential for simplifying complex expressions, such as (2 + 3) * (4 - 1).

- Myth: The order of operations is based on the order in which the numbers appear in the expression.
Reality: The order of operations is based on a specific set of rules, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction).
Why people believe this: Some individuals may think that the order of operations is determined by the order in which the numbers appear in the expression. However, this is not a reliable method, as it can lead to incorrect results.

- Myth: Exponents and roots are evaluated after multiplication and division.
Reality: Exponents and roots are evaluated before multiplication and division.
Why people believe this: The misconception may arise from the fact that exponents and roots are often evaluated last in a calculation. However, according to the order of operations, exponents and roots are evaluated second, after parentheses.

- Myth: Multiplication and division are evaluated from left to right.
Reality: Multiplication and division are evaluated from left to right, but they have the same precedence, meaning that the order in which they appear in the expression does not affect the result.
Why people believe this: Some people may think that multiplication is evaluated before division, or vice versa. However, this is not the case, as both operations have the same precedence.

- Myth: Addition and subtraction are evaluated from right to left.
Reality: Addition and subtraction are evaluated from left to right.
Why people believe this: The misconception may arise from the fact that some people may think that the order of operations is reversed for addition and subtraction. However, this is not the case, as addition and subtraction are evaluated from left to right.

- Myth: The order of operations does not apply to fractions.
Reality: The order of operations applies to all mathematical expressions, including fractions.
Why people believe this: Some individuals may think that fractions are exempt from the order of operations. However, this is not the case, as the order of operations is essential for simplifying fractions and solving equations that involve fractions.

3. HOW TO REMEMBER:
To avoid common misconceptions about the order of operations, it is essential to remember the acronym PEMDAS. Each letter in the acronym represents a step in the order of operations: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction. By following this order, individuals can ensure that they are evaluating expressions correctly. Additionally, it is crucial to practice applying the order of operations to different types of expressions, including complex expressions and fractions.

4. SUMMARY:
The one thing to remember to avoid confusion about the order of operations is to follow the PEMDAS acronym. By understanding and applying the order of operations correctly, individuals can simplify expressions, solve equations, and avoid common mistakes. It is essential to remember that the order of operations applies to all mathematical expressions, regardless of their complexity, and that it is based on a specific set of rules, not the order in which the numbers appear in the expression. By following the order of operations and practicing its application, individuals can become proficient in mathematics and avoid common misconceptions.
