# What Is Pythagorean Theorem?

Pythagorean theorem refers to a fundamental concept in geometry that describes the relationship between the lengths of the sides of a right-angled triangle.

The Pythagorean theorem is a mathematical principle that can be used to find the length of the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle, which is the side opposite the right angle. This theorem is based on the idea that the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. The theorem is often expressed as a² + b² = c², where a and b are the lengths of the two sides that form the right angle, and c is the length of the hypotenuse.

To understand the Pythagorean theorem, it is essential to know the different parts of a right-angled triangle. A right-angled triangle has one angle that is 90 degrees, which is called the right angle. The side opposite the right angle is called the hypotenuse, and the other two sides are called the legs. The Pythagorean theorem can be applied to any right-angled triangle, regardless of the length of its sides.

The Pythagorean theorem has numerous applications in various fields, including architecture, engineering, and physics. It can be used to calculate distances, heights, and lengths of objects, making it a crucial concept in problem-solving and critical thinking. The theorem is also used in trigonometry, which is the study of the relationships between the sides and angles of triangles.

Key components of the Pythagorean theorem include:
* The hypotenuse, which is the side opposite the right angle
* The legs, which are the two sides that form the right angle
* The formula a² + b² = c², where a and b are the lengths of the legs and c is the length of the hypotenuse
* The concept of squaring the lengths of the sides, which is essential to the theorem
* The idea that the theorem only applies to right-angled triangles
* The ability to use the theorem to find the length of any side of a right-angled triangle, given the lengths of the other two sides

Despite its simplicity, the Pythagorean theorem is often misunderstood, leading to common misconceptions, such as:
* The theorem only applies to triangles with integer side lengths, which is not true
* The theorem can be used to find the length of any side of any triangle, which is incorrect
* The formula a² + b² = c² can be rearranged to solve for any variable, without considering the constraints of the theorem
* The theorem is only useful for simple problems, and is not applicable to complex real-world situations

A real-world example of the Pythagorean theorem can be seen in the construction of a building. Suppose a builder wants to place a ladder against a wall, and the ladder is 10 feet long. If the builder wants the ladder to be 3 feet away from the wall, how far up the wall will the ladder reach? Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can calculate the height of the ladder against the wall. Let's call the height of the ladder "h". We know that the ladder is the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle, with one leg being the distance from the wall (3 feet) and the other leg being the height of the ladder (h). We can use the formula a² + b² = c², where a = 3 feet, b = h, and c = 10 feet. Plugging in the values, we get 3² + h² = 10², which simplifies to 9 + h² = 100. Solving for h, we get h² = 91, and h = √91, which is approximately 9.54 feet. Therefore, the ladder will reach approximately 9.54 feet up the wall.

In summary, the Pythagorean theorem is a fundamental concept in geometry that describes the relationship between the lengths of the sides of a right-angled triangle, and can be used to find the length of the hypotenuse or any other side, given the lengths of the other two sides.
