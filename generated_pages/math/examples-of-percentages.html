        <h1>Example of Percentages</h1>

        

        <p>1. INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>A percentage is a way to express a part of a whole as a fraction of 100. It is often used to describe a proportion or a rate of change. Percentages are commonly used in various aspects of life, including mathematics, science, finance, and everyday applications. Understanding percentages is essential for making informed decisions and solving problems.</p>

<p>2. EVERYDAY EXAMPLES</p>
<p>Percentages are used in many everyday situations. For instance, a store may offer a 20% discount on all items during a sale. If a shirt originally costs $50, the discount would be $10, and the new price would be $40. Another example is a student scoring 85% on a test, meaning they answered 85 out of 100 questions correctly. Additionally, a person may have a 25% chance of winning a prize in a contest, indicating that one out of every four people will win. A savings account may also offer a 2% annual interest rate, meaning that for every $100 deposited, $2 will be added as interest each year.</p>

<p>3. NOTABLE EXAMPLES</p>
<p>There are several notable examples of percentages in history and science. The concept of a 360-degree circle is based on the idea that a circle is divided into 360 equal parts, with each part representing a percentage of the whole. The human body is made up of approximately 60% water, with the remaining 40% consisting of other substances. The process of photosynthesis in plants involves converting 3-6% of sunlight into energy, which is then used to fuel growth and development.</p>

<p>4. EDGE CASES</p>
<p>Some unusual examples of percentages include the percentage of people who have a rare blood type, such as Rh-null, which is found in less than 1% of the population. Another example is the percentage of ocean water that is fresh, which is approximately 2.5%. These examples illustrate how percentages can be used to describe small or unusual proportions.</p>

<p>5. NON-EXAMPLES</p>
<p>There are several things that people often confuse with percentages, but are not actually percentages. A ratio, such as a student-to-teacher ratio of 10:1, is not a percentage. A decimal value, such as 0.5, is also not a percentage, although it can be converted to a percentage by multiplying by 100. A fraction, such as 1/2, is also not a percentage, although it can be converted to a percentage by dividing the numerator by the denominator and multiplying by 100.</p>

<p>6. PATTERN</p>
<p>All valid examples of percentages have one thing in common: they describe a part of a whole as a fraction of 100. Whether it is a discount, a score, a chance of winning, or a proportion of a substance, percentages are used to express a proportion or rate of change. This common thread runs through all examples of percentages, from everyday applications to notable and unusual examples. By understanding this pattern, individuals can better recognize and work with percentages in a variety of contexts.</p>
