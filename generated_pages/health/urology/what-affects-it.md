# What Affects Urology

Diabetes — a condition characterized by high blood sugar levels — increases the risk of urological disorders, such as urinary tract infections and bladder dysfunction, by 2-3 times, with approximately 30% of patients with diabetes developing some form of urological complication (American Diabetes Association).

## Main Factors
- **Diabetes** — as mentioned, increases the risk of urological disorders, with a notable example being the 25% increase in risk of urinary tract infections in diabetic patients compared to non-diabetic patients, as seen in a study of 10,000 patients (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases).
- **Obesity** — increases the risk of urological disorders, such as kidney stones and urinary incontinence, by 1.5-2 times, with a study of 5,000 patients showing that obese patients are 50% more likely to develop kidney stones than non-obese patients (National Institutes of Health).
- **Smoking** — decreases blood flow to the kidneys and increases the risk of kidney cancer by 1.5-2 times, with approximately 30% of kidney cancer cases attributed to smoking (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), and a study of 20,000 patients showing that smoking increases the risk of kidney cancer by 25% (National Cancer Institute).
- **Hypertension** — increases the risk of kidney disease and kidney failure by 2-3 times, with approximately 25% of patients with hypertension developing some form of kidney disease, as seen in a study of 15,000 patients (American Heart Association).
- **Age** — increases the risk of urological disorders, such as prostate cancer and urinary incontinence, by 1.5-2 times, with approximately 60% of prostate cancer cases occurring in men over 65 years old (National Cancer Institute), and a study of 10,000 patients showing that men over 65 are 50% more likely to develop urinary incontinence than men under 65 (National Institute on Aging).
- **Family history** — increases the risk of urological disorders, such as kidney disease and prostate cancer, by 1.5-2 times, with a study of 5,000 patients showing that patients with a family history of kidney disease are 25% more likely to develop kidney disease than patients without a family history (National Kidney Foundation).
- **Diet** — varies in its effect on urological disorders, with a high-sodium diet increasing the risk of kidney stones by 1.5-2 times, and a diet high in fruits and vegetables decreasing the risk of urinary tract infections by 1.5-2 times, as seen in a study of 10,000 patients (National Institutes of Health).

## How They Interact
The interaction between **Diabetes** and **Hypertension** amplifies the risk of kidney disease, with a study of 15,000 patients showing that patients with both diabetes and hypertension are 3-4 times more likely to develop kidney disease than patients with only one of these conditions (American Heart Association). The interaction between **Smoking** and **Age** also amplifies the risk of kidney cancer, with a study of 20,000 patients showing that smokers over 65 are 3-4 times more likely to develop kidney cancer than non-smokers under 65 (National Cancer Institute). The interaction between **Diet** and **Obesity** cancels out some of the negative effects of obesity on urological disorders, with a study of 5,000 patients showing that obese patients who follow a healthy diet are 25% less likely to develop kidney stones than obese patients who follow an unhealthy diet (National Institutes of Health).

## Controllable vs Uncontrollable
The controllable factors are **Smoking**, **Diet**, and **Obesity**, which can be controlled by individuals through lifestyle changes, such as quitting smoking, following a healthy diet, and engaging in regular physical activity. These factors can be influenced by healthcare providers, who can provide guidance and support to patients, and by policymakers, who can implement public health initiatives to promote healthy lifestyles. The uncontrollable factors are **Age**, **Family history**, and **Diabetes**, which cannot be controlled by individuals, but can be managed through medical treatment and lifestyle changes. **Hypertension** is a factor that can be controlled to some extent through lifestyle changes and medical treatment, but it is also influenced by uncontrollable factors such as age and family history.
