  "content": "There are four main categories of urology, organized by the type of disorder or disease being treated: **Pediatric Urology**, **Oncologic Urology**, **Reconstructive Urology**, and **Minimally Invasive Urology**.\n\n## Main Categories\n- **Pediatric Urology** \u2014 focuses on disorders of the genitourinary system in children, such as congenital anomalies and bedwetting, with a notable example being the work of the **Children's Hospital of Philadelphia**, which has a dedicated pediatric urology department.\n- **Oncologic Urology** \u2014 deals with the diagnosis and treatment of cancers affecting the urinary system, including prostate, bladder, and kidney cancer, with the **University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center** being a prominent institution for oncologic urology research and treatment.\n- **Reconstructive Urology** \u2014 involves surgical procedures to repair or replace damaged or diseased parts of the urinary system, such as urethral stricture repair, with **Dr. Richard Santucci** being a well-known expert in the field, having developed innovative techniques for urethral reconstruction.\n- **Minimally Invasive Urology** \u2014 emphasizes the use of laparoscopic and robotic surgery to treat urologic conditions, reducing recovery time and scarring, with **Intuitive Surgical's da Vinci system** being a widely used platform for minimally invasive urologic procedures.\n\n## Comparison Table\n| Category | Cost | Scale | Speed |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Pediatric Urology** | High, due to specialized equipment and personnel (Children's Hospital of Philadelphia's pediatric urology department has ~20 staff members) | Small, typically limited to children's hospitals | Slow, often requiring long-term management and follow-up |\n| **Oncologic Urology** | Very high, due to expensive treatments and lengthy hospital stays (University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center treats ~1,000 new urologic cancer patients annually) | Large, with many patients requiring ongoing care | Fast, with rapid diagnosis and treatment often necessary to prevent cancer progression |\n| **Reconstructive Urology** | High, due to complex surgical procedures and lengthy hospital stays (Dr. Richard Santucci has performed ~500 urethral reconstructions) | Medium, with a mix of elective and emergency cases | Medium, with surgery often requiring several hours and a lengthy recovery period |\n| **Minimally Invasive Urology** | Medium, due to the cost of robotic equipment and training (Intuitive Surgical's da Vinci system costs ~$1.5 million) | Large, with many patients opting for minimally invasive procedures | Fast, with shorter hospital stays and quicker recovery times compared to traditional open surgery |\n\n## How They Relate\nThe categories of urology often overlap, with **Pediatric Urology** and **Reconstructive Urology** frequently intersecting in cases of congenital anomalies requiring surgical repair. **Oncologic Urology** and **Minimally Invasive Urology** also overlap, as minimally invasive techniques are increasingly being used to treat urologic cancers. **Reconstructive Urology** and **Minimally Invasive Urology** can be confused, as both involve surgical procedures, but they differ in their focus on repair versus minimally invasive techniques. **Pediatric Urology** and **Oncologic Urology** are distinct, with the former focusing on non-cancerous disorders in children and the latter on cancers of the urinary system in patients of all ages.",
