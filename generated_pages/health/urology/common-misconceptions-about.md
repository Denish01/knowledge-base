# Common Misconceptions About Urology

The most common misconception about urology is that it only deals with male health issues, particularly those related to the prostate.

## Misconceptions
- **Myth:** Urology is a male-dominated field that only deals with prostate issues.
- **Fact:** Urologists treat a wide range of conditions, including kidney stones, bladder problems, and urinary tract infections, which affect both men and women, with approximately 60% of urologists' workload being dedicated to non-prostate issues (American Urological Association).
- **Source of confusion:** This myth persists due to the media narrative surrounding prostate cancer awareness, which often overshadows other urological conditions.
- **Myth:** Drinking cranberry juice can cure urinary tract infections.
- **Fact:** While cranberry juice may help prevent UTIs, it is not a cure, and antibiotics are still the most effective treatment, with a 90% success rate (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases).
- **Source of confusion:** The misconception that cranberry juice is a cure-all for UTIs may stem from the fact that some studies suggest it can help prevent UTIs in certain populations, such as women with recurrent infections.
- **Myth:** Urodynamic testing is only used for older adults.
- **Fact:** Urodynamic testing is used to diagnose and treat a range of conditions, including urinary incontinence, and can be used for patients of all ages, including children, with approximately 20% of pediatric patients undergoing urodynamic testing (Society for Urodynamics and Female Urology).
- **Source of confusion:** The myth that urodynamic testing is only for older adults may be due to the fact that many urodynamic testing devices were initially designed with older adults in mind.
- **Myth:** Kidney stones are extremely rare.
- **Fact:** Kidney stones affect approximately 1 in 10 people in the United States, with over 500,000 people visiting the emergency room each year due to kidney stone-related issues (National Kidney Foundation).
- **Source of confusion:** The misconception that kidney stones are rare may be due to the lack of public awareness campaigns and education on the topic.
- **Myth:** Robotic surgery is not commonly used in urology.
- **Fact:** Robotic surgery is a common treatment option for many urological conditions, including prostate cancer, kidney cancer, and bladder cancer, with over 100,000 robotic surgeries performed annually (Intuitive Surgical).
- **Source of confusion:** The myth that robotic surgery is not commonly used in urology may be due to the high cost of robotic equipment and the limited availability of trained robotic surgeons.
- **Myth:** Urologists only perform surgery.
- **Fact:** Urologists provide a range of services, including medical management of conditions such as urinary incontinence, kidney disease, and erectile dysfunction, with approximately 70% of urologists' time spent on non-surgical care (American Urological Association).
- **Source of confusion:** The misconception that urologists only perform surgery may be due to the fact that many urologists are trained surgeons and the public may associate urology with surgical procedures.
