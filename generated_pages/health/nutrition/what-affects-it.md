# What Affects Nutrition

Socioeconomic status is the single biggest factor affecting nutrition, as it **decreases** access to healthy food options, with a study by the United States Department of Agriculture finding that 29% of low-income households experience food insecurity (United States Department of Agriculture).

## Main Factors
- **Income level** — the specific mechanism is that higher income allows for greater purchasing power, which **increases** access to nutritious food, with the World Health Organization reporting that every 10% increase in income leads to a 6% increase in fruit and vegetable consumption (World Health Organization), as seen in Japan where the average person consumes 64 kg of fruits and vegetables per year (Food and Agriculture Organization).
- **Geographic location** — the mechanism is that proximity to food sources and transportation infrastructure affects food availability, which **varies** depending on the region, with the average person in rural Africa consuming 73 kg of staple foods per year, while in urban Europe it is 55 kg (Food and Agriculture Organization).
- **Education level** — the mechanism is that knowledge of nutrition and health **increases** with education, leading to better food choices, with a study by the National Center for Education Statistics finding that 75% of adults with a bachelor's degree or higher report eating five or more servings of fruits and vegetables per day (National Center for Education Statistics).
- **Cultural background** — the mechanism is that traditional dietary practices and cultural preferences **influence** food choices, with the average person in India consuming 30 kg of pulses per year, which are a staple in Indian cuisine (Food and Agriculture Organization).
- **Physical activity level** — the mechanism is that higher energy expenditure **increases** nutrient needs, with the International Journal of Sports Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism recommending that athletes consume 55-65% of their daily calories from carbohydrates (International Journal of Sports Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism).
- **Government policies** — the mechanism is that subsidies, taxes, and regulations **affect** food prices and availability, with Ricardo's comparative advantage model (1817) explaining how trade policies influence food trade, and the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy, which spends ~38 billion euros annually on agricultural subsidies (European Commission), **increasing** the production of staple crops.
- **Food marketing** — the mechanism is that advertising and labeling **influence** consumer food choices, with the average American seeing 4,000 to 10,000 ads per day (Federal Trade Commission), **increasing** the consumption of processed foods, such as sugary snacks, which account for 27% of the average American's daily calorie intake (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).

## How They Interact
The interaction between **income level** and **geographic location** amplifies the effect on nutrition, as seen in the example of rural Africa where low income and limited access to food sources **decrease** access to nutritious food, with the average person consuming only 22 kg of fruits and vegetables per year (Food and Agriculture Organization). The interaction between **education level** and **cultural background** also affects nutrition, as educated individuals from diverse cultural backgrounds are more likely to make informed food choices, such as the 60% of Asian Americans who report eating a traditional diet, which is high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains (National Institutes of Health). The interaction between **government policies** and **food marketing** can also influence nutrition, as seen in the example of the European Union's food labeling regulations, which **increase** consumer awareness of nutritional content, with 75% of European consumers reporting that they check food labels before making a purchase (European Commission).

## Controllable vs Uncontrollable
The controllable factors are **income level**, **education level**, and **physical activity level**, which can be controlled by individuals through their lifestyle choices, such as pursuing higher education, which **increases** earning potential, or engaging in regular physical activity, which **increases** energy expenditure. The uncontrollable factors are **geographic location**, **cultural background**, **government policies**, and **food marketing**, which are influenced by external factors such as where one is born, their family's cultural traditions, or the policies implemented by their government. However, individuals can still make informed choices within these constraints, such as seeking out local food sources or supporting policies that promote healthy food options.
