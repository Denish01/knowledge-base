  "content": "Water is the most critical dependency for nutrition, as its absence can lead to dehydration and malnutrition, with the World Food Programme reporting that ~2 billion people live in water-stressed areas.\n\n## Key Dependencies\n- **Adequate Water Intake** \u2014 necessary for digestion, absorption, and transport of nutrients, with the World Health Organization (WHO) recommending at least 2 liters of water per day for adults, and the absence of which can cause dehydration, as seen in the 2011 famine in Somalia where ~260,000 people died due to lack of access to clean water.\n- **Sufficient Macronutrient Intake** \u2014 required for energy production and growth, with the National Academy of Sciences recommending a daily intake of 45-65% of calories from carbohydrates, 20-35% from fat, and 10-35% from protein, and the absence of which can cause conditions such as kwashiorkor, as seen in the 1990s in North Korea where ~1 million people died due to famine and malnutrition.\n- **Adequate Micronutrient Intake** \u2014 necessary for maintaining immune function and preventing diseases, with the WHO recommending a daily intake of essential vitamins and minerals such as vitamin C, vitamin D, and iron, and the absence of which can cause conditions such as scurvy, as seen in the 18th century in sailors who did not have access to citrus fruits.\n- **Proper Gut Health** \u2014 required for the absorption and utilization of nutrients, with the Human Microbiome Project reporting that an imbalance of gut bacteria can lead to conditions such as malabsorption and inflammatory bowel disease, and the absence of which can cause diarrhea and malnutrition, as seen in the 2010 cholera outbreak in Haiti where ~10,000 people died due to inadequate sanitation and hygiene.\n- **Access to Sanitation and Hygiene** \u2014 necessary for preventing the spread of diseases and maintaining a healthy environment, with the WHO reporting that ~2.3 billion people lack access to basic sanitation facilities, and the absence of which can cause the spread of diseases such as cholera, as seen in the 2010 outbreak in Haiti.\n- **Adequate Healthcare Access** \u2014 required for the prevention and treatment of diseases, with the WHO reporting that ~400 million people lack access to essential healthcare services, and the absence of which can cause conditions such as malnutrition, as seen in the 1990s in Rwanda where ~1 million people died due to genocide and lack of access to healthcare.\n\n## Priority Order\nThe priority order of these dependencies is: \n1. **Adequate Water Intake**, as dehydration can occur within days of inadequate water intake, and can cause severe health problems and even death.\n2. **Sufficient Macronutrient Intake**, as inadequate macronutrient intake can cause malnutrition and related health problems.\n3. **Adequate Micronutrient Intake**, as inadequate micronutrient intake can cause conditions such as scurvy and rickets.\n4. **Proper Gut Health**, as an imbalance of gut bacteria can lead to conditions such as malabsorption and inflammatory bowel disease.\n5. **Access to Sanitation and Hygiene**, as inadequate sanitation and hygiene can cause the spread of diseases such as cholera.\n6. **Adequate Healthcare Access**, as lack of access to healthcare can cause conditions such as malnutrition and related health problems.\n\n## Common Gaps\nPeople often overlook the importance of **Access to Sanitation and Hygiene**, assuming that it is not directly related to nutrition, but the absence of which can cause the spread of diseases and malnutrition, as seen in the 2010 cholera outbreak in Haiti. Additionally, people may take for granted the importance of **Proper Gut Health**, assuming that it is not essential for nutrition, but an imbalance of gut bacteria can lead to conditions such as malabsorption and inflammatory bowel disease.",
