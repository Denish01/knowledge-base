# How Nutrition Works

Nutrition works through the **digestion** and **absorption** of nutrients from food, which are then utilized by the body to produce energy, support growth, and maintain overall health. The core mechanism involves the breakdown of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats into simpler molecules that can be absorbed and utilized by the body, with the liver playing a central role in regulating nutrient distribution and metabolism.

## The Mechanism
The digestive system breaks down food into smaller molecules, which are then absorbed into the bloodstream and distributed to cells throughout the body, where they are utilized to produce energy, build and repair tissues, and maintain various bodily functions. This process is mediated by **hormones** such as insulin and glucagon, which regulate blood sugar levels and nutrient metabolism.

## Step-by-Step
1. **Ingestion** of food stimulates the release of digestive enzymes, such as amylase and lipase, which break down carbohydrates and fats into simpler molecules, with the average person consuming around 2,000 calories per day (United States Department of Agriculture).
2. The **small intestine** absorbs these broken-down molecules into the bloodstream, with approximately 90% of nutrient absorption occurring in the small intestine (Guyton and Hall, 2016).
3. The **liver** processes the absorbed nutrients, regulating blood sugar levels and distributing nutrients to the rest of the body, with the liver accounting for around 20% of the body's total energy expenditure (Hall, 2012).
4. **Cells** throughout the body utilize the absorbed nutrients to produce energy, build and repair tissues, and maintain various bodily functions, with the brain alone accounting for around 20% of the body's total energy expenditure (Siesjö, 1978).
5. **Waste products** are eliminated from the body through the excretory system, with the kidneys filtering around 180 liters of blood per day (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases).
6. The **gut microbiome** plays a crucial role in maintaining a healthy digestive system, with an estimated 100 trillion microorganisms residing in the gut (Backhed et al., 2005).

## Key Components
- **Carbohydrates** provide energy for the body, with glucose being the primary source of energy for the brain and red blood cells.
- **Proteins** build and repair tissues, with the average person requiring around 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day (World Health Organization).
- **Fats** provide energy and support the absorption of vitamins, with the average person consuming around 70 grams of fat per day (United States Department of Agriculture).
- **Vitamins** and **minerals** support various bodily functions, with vitamin C being essential for the production of collagen and iron being essential for the production of hemoglobin.

## Common Questions
What happens if the digestive system is not functioning properly? 
The digestive system's malfunction can lead to conditions such as **malabsorption**, where the body is unable to absorb essential nutrients, resulting in deficiencies and related health problems. 
What role does the liver play in nutrition? 
The liver regulates blood sugar levels and distributes nutrients to the rest of the body, with liver disease potentially leading to **hypoglycemia** and other metabolic disorders. 
What is the importance of the gut microbiome in nutrition? 
The gut microbiome supports the digestion and absorption of nutrients, with an imbalance of the gut microbiome, also known as **dysbiosis**, potentially leading to digestive disorders and other health problems. 
How does the body regulate nutrient distribution and metabolism? 
The body regulates nutrient distribution and metabolism through **hormones** such as insulin and glucagon, which respond to changes in blood sugar levels and nutrient availability.
