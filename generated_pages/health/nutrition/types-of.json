  "content": "There are six main categories of nutrition, organized by their primary source of energy and nutrients: **Macronutrient-based nutrition**, **Micronutrient-based nutrition**, **Plant-based nutrition**, **Animal-based nutrition**, **Supplement-based nutrition**, and **Functional nutrition**.\n\n## Main Categories\n- **Macronutrient-based nutrition** focuses on the three main energy-providing nutrients: carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, with a concrete example being the **Atkins diet**, which restricts carbohydrate intake to induce weight loss.\n- **Micronutrient-based nutrition** emphasizes the importance of vitamins and minerals, such as the **DASH diet**, which is rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains to help manage blood pressure.\n- **Plant-based nutrition** centers around plant-derived foods, including the **Ornish diet**, which is a lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet that has been shown to reverse heart disease.\n- **Animal-based nutrition** relies on animal products as primary sources of nutrition, with the **Paleo diet** being a notable example, which excludes grains, dairy, and processed foods.\n- **Supplement-based nutrition** involves the use of dietary supplements to fill nutritional gaps, such as **Ensure**, a brand of nutritional supplements designed for older adults or those with specific dietary needs.\n- **Functional nutrition** focuses on using food to address specific health issues, such as the **FODMAP diet**, which is used to manage irritable bowel syndrome.\n\n## Comparison Table\n| Category | Primary Source | Cost | Speed of Results |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Macronutrient-based nutrition** | Carbohydrates, proteins, fats | Moderate | Variable |\n| **Micronutrient-based nutrition** | Fruits, vegetables, whole grains | Low-Moderate | Long-term |\n| **Plant-based nutrition** | Plant-derived foods | Low-Moderate | Variable |\n| **Animal-based nutrition** | Animal products | High | Rapid |\n| **Supplement-based nutrition** | Dietary supplements | High | Rapid |\n| **Functional nutrition** | Specific foods for health issues | Moderate-High | Variable |\n\n## How They Relate\nThe categories of nutrition often overlap, with **Macronutrient-based nutrition** and **Micronutrient-based nutrition** being closely related, as a diet that is balanced in terms of macronutrients is also likely to provide adequate micronutrients. **Plant-based nutrition** and **Animal-based nutrition** are distinct but can be combined in a **Flexitarian diet**, which is primarily plant-based but includes occasional consumption of animal products. **Supplement-based nutrition** can be used in conjunction with any of the other categories to fill nutritional gaps, while **Functional nutrition** can involve elements of all the other categories, as it uses specific foods to address health issues. For example, the **Ornish diet**, which is a type of **Plant-based nutrition**, also incorporates elements of **Functional nutrition** by using diet to reverse heart disease.",
