        <p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Health promotion is a vital aspect of healthcare that involves activities and initiatives aimed at improving the overall well-being of individuals and communities.

<p>HOW THEY RELATE</p>
<p>The different categories of health promotion are interconnected and often overlap.

<p>SUMMARY</p>
