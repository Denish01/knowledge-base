# What Affects Gerontology

Socioeconomic status is the single biggest factor affecting **gerontology**, as it determines access to healthcare, nutrition, and living conditions, which in turn influence life expectancy and healthspan, with a 10-year difference in life expectancy between the richest and poorest 1% of the population (World Health Organization).

## Main Factors
- **Genetics** — influences disease susceptibility, decreases life expectancy by 5-10 years in individuals with high-risk genetic profiles, such as those with **BRCA1** and **BRCA2** mutations, which increase the risk of breast and ovarian cancer by 40-85% (National Cancer Institute), as seen in the case of Angelina Jolie, who underwent preventive surgery due to her high-risk genetic profile.
- **Diet** — affects nutritional status, increases life expectancy by 2-5 years in individuals consuming a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, such as the **Mediterranean diet**, which has been shown to reduce the risk of heart disease by 30% (American Heart Association), as exemplified by the high percentage of centenarians in **Ikaria, Greece**, where the traditional diet is rich in **omega-3 fatty acids** and **antioxidants**.
- **Physical activity** — influences cardiovascular health, increases life expectancy by 3-7 years in individuals engaging in regular physical activity, such as **aerobic exercise**, which has been shown to reduce the risk of mortality by 30% (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), as seen in the case of **Jack LaLanne**, who lived to be 96 and credited his longevity to regular exercise and a healthy lifestyle.
- **Smoking** — decreases life expectancy by 10-15 years in individuals who smoke regularly, as it increases the risk of **lung cancer** and **cardiovascular disease** by 20-30% (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), as exemplified by the high mortality rates among **smokers** in **China**, where tobacco use is prevalent.
- **Access to healthcare** — affects health outcomes, increases life expectancy by 5-10 years in individuals with access to regular health check-ups and preventive care, such as **vaccinations** and **screenings**, which have been shown to reduce the risk of mortality by 20-30% (World Health Organization), as seen in the case of **Japan**, where universal healthcare and preventive care have contributed to a high life expectancy.
- **Social connections** — influences mental health, increases life expectancy by 2-5 years in individuals with strong social support networks, such as **family** and **friends**, which have been shown to reduce the risk of **depression** and **anxiety** by 20-30% (National Institute of Mental Health), as exemplified by the high percentage of **centenarians** in **Okinawa, Japan**, where social connections and community support are highly valued.
- **Environmental factors** — affects exposure to pollution and toxins, decreases life expectancy by 2-5 years in individuals living in areas with high levels of **air pollution**, such as **Beijing, China**, where poor air quality has been linked to an increased risk of **respiratory disease** by 20-30% (World Health Organization).

## How They Interact
The interaction between **genetics** and **environmental factors** can amplify the risk of disease, as individuals with high-risk genetic profiles may be more susceptible to the negative effects of environmental toxins, such as **pesticides** and **heavy metals**, which have been shown to increase the risk of **neurodegenerative disease** by 20-30% (National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences). For example, individuals with a family history of **Alzheimer's disease** may be more likely to develop the disease if they are exposed to high levels of **air pollution**, which has been linked to an increased risk of cognitive decline by 10-20% (Harvard School of Public Health). The interaction between **diet** and **physical activity** can also have a synergistic effect, as a balanced diet and regular exercise can reduce the risk of **chronic disease** by 30-40% (American Heart Association), as seen in the case of **athletes** who follow a strict training and nutrition regimen.

## Controllable vs Uncontrollable
The controllable factors, such as **diet**, **physical activity**, and **smoking**, can be influenced by individual choices and behaviors, and are often shaped by **socioeconomic status** and **access to healthcare**, which are controlled by **governments** and **healthcare systems**. For example, **governments** can implement policies to promote healthy behaviors, such as **taxing sugary drinks** and **subsidizing gym memberships**, while **healthcare systems** can provide **preventive care** and **education** to individuals. The uncontrollable factors, such as **genetics** and **environmental factors**, are often outside of individual control, but can be mitigated by **technological advancements**, such as **genetic testing** and **air pollution reduction**, which can be developed and implemented by **research institutions** and **private companies**.
