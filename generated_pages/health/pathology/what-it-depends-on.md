# What Pathology Depends On

Pathology depends on **Accurate Clinical History** — without it, diagnoses can be incorrect or delayed, as seen in the case of Libby Zion, whose death was attributed to a misdiagnosis that might have been avoided with a more thorough medical history.

## Key Dependencies
- **Accurate Clinical History** — required for correct diagnoses, and its absence can lead to misdiagnosis, as in the case of Libby Zion, where incomplete information contributed to a fatal outcome.
- **Reliable Laboratory Results** — necessary for confirming diagnoses, and without them, treatment may be ineffective, such as in the case of the Therac-25 radiation therapy machine, where faulty sensors led to lethal doses of radiation being administered to patients.
- **Effective Communication** — crucial for collaboration among healthcare professionals, and its breakdown can result in errors, as seen in the case of the Duke University Medical Center, where a patient received a heart-lung transplant with the wrong blood type due to a miscommunication.
- **Standardized Protocols** — essential for ensuring consistency in treatment and care, and their absence can lead to confusion and mistakes, such as in the case of the Bristol Royal Infirmary, where a lack of standardized protocols contributed to high mortality rates in pediatric cardiac surgery.
- **Ongoing Education and Training** — necessary for staying current with the latest medical knowledge and techniques, and without it, healthcare professionals may not be equipped to provide optimal care, as seen in the case of the Halifax Hospital, where a lack of training in a new medical procedure led to a series of adverse events.
- **Quality Control Measures** — required to ensure the accuracy and reliability of diagnostic tests and treatments, and their absence can lead to errors and patient harm, such as in the case of the New York State Department of Health, where a lack of quality control measures led to the contamination of blood samples and incorrect diagnoses.

## Priority Order
The dependencies can be ranked in order of criticality as follows:
- **Accurate Clinical History**, as it is the foundation of diagnosis and treatment
- **Reliable Laboratory Results**, because they are often used to confirm diagnoses and guide treatment
- **Effective Communication**, since it is essential for collaboration and preventing errors
- **Standardized Protocols**, as they ensure consistency and reduce the risk of mistakes
- **Ongoing Education and Training**, because it is necessary for staying current with the latest medical knowledge and techniques
- **Quality Control Measures**, which are necessary to ensure the accuracy and reliability of diagnostic tests and treatments, but can be seen as a subset of the other dependencies.

## Common Gaps
People often overlook or take for granted the importance of **Standardized Protocols**, assuming that healthcare professionals will always follow best practices, but this assumption can lead to errors and patient harm, as seen in the case of the Bristol Royal Infirmary, where a lack of standardized protocols contributed to high mortality rates in pediatric cardiac surgery. Another common gap is the assumption that **Effective Communication** will always occur, but this can lead to miscommunication and errors, such as in the case of the Duke University Medical Center, where a patient received a heart-lung transplant with the wrong blood type due to a miscommunication.
