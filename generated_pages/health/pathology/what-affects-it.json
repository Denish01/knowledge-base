  "content": "Genetics is the single biggest factor affecting **pathology**, with heritable conditions such as sickle cell anemia and cystic fibrosis increasing the risk of disease by 50-100% (National Institutes of Health).\n\n## Main Factors\n- **Genetics** \u2014 genetic mutations increase the risk of pathology, with a magnitude of 50-100%, as seen in the case of Huntington's disease, where a single mutation increases the risk of developing the disease by 100% (National Institutes of Health).\n- **Environmental toxins** \u2014 exposure to toxins such as lead and mercury decreases the body's ability to function properly, with a magnitude of 10-30%, as seen in the case of lead exposure, which decreases IQ by 5-10 points (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).\n- **Lifestyle choices** \u2014 poor diet and lack of exercise increase the risk of pathology, with a magnitude of 20-50%, as seen in the case of obesity, which increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 20-30% (World Health Organization).\n- **Infectious agents** \u2014 exposure to infectious agents such as bacteria and viruses increases the risk of pathology, with a magnitude of 10-90%, as seen in the case of tuberculosis, which increases the risk of developing lung disease by 50-70% (World Health Organization).\n- **Age** \u2014 increasing age increases the risk of pathology, with a magnitude of 10-50%, as seen in the case of Alzheimer's disease, which increases the risk of developing dementia by 10-20% per decade after age 65 (Alzheimer's Association).\n- **Socioeconomic status** \u2014 low socioeconomic status increases the risk of pathology, with a magnitude of 10-30%, as seen in the case of poverty, which increases the risk of developing mental health disorders by 10-20% (World Health Organization).\n- **Access to healthcare** \u2014 lack of access to healthcare increases the risk of pathology, with a magnitude of 10-50%, as seen in the case of lack of health insurance, which increases the risk of developing untreated chronic conditions by 20-30% (Kaiser Family Foundation).\n\n## How They Interact\nThe interaction between **genetics** and **environmental toxins** can amplify the risk of pathology, as seen in the case of genetic predisposition to lead poisoning, which increases the risk of developing neurological disorders by 50-100% (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). The interaction between **lifestyle choices** and **infectious agents** can also amplify the risk of pathology, as seen in the case of poor diet and increased risk of infection, which increases the risk of developing sepsis by 20-50% (World Health Organization). The interaction between **age** and **access to healthcare** can cancel each other out, as seen in the case of older adults with access to healthcare, which decreases the risk of developing untreated chronic conditions by 10-20% (Kaiser Family Foundation).\n\n## Controllable vs Uncontrollable\nThe controllable factors affecting pathology are **lifestyle choices**, **environmental toxins**, and **access to healthcare**, which can be controlled by individuals, governments, and healthcare providers, respectively. For example, individuals can control their diet and exercise habits to reduce the risk of obesity by 20-30% (World Health Organization). Governments can control environmental toxins by implementing regulations and policies, such as reducing lead emissions by 90% (Environmental Protection Agency). Healthcare providers can control access to healthcare by increasing the availability of healthcare services, such as increasing the number of primary care physicians by 10-20% (Health Resources and Services Administration). The uncontrollable factors are **genetics**, **age**, and **infectious agents**, which are determined by biological and environmental factors beyond human control.",
