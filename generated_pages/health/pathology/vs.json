  "content": "## Definition\nPathology Compared is a diagnostic approach that involves the systematic analysis and comparison of **pathological findings** to determine the underlying cause of a disease or condition, developed by Rudolf Virchow in 1858.\n\n## How It Works\nThe process of Pathology Compared begins with the collection of **tissue samples** from patients, which are then examined using various techniques such as **histopathology** and **cytopathology**. This examination reveals the **morphological features** of the cells and tissues, which are then compared to a set of established **diagnostic criteria**. For example, the **World Health Organization (WHO)** has established a set of criteria for the diagnosis of **cancer**, which includes the presence of **uncontrolled cell growth** and **tumor formation**. By comparing the pathological findings to these criteria, pathologists can determine the type and severity of the disease.\n\nThe comparison of pathological findings is facilitated by the use of **disease classification systems**, such as the **International Classification of Diseases (ICD)**. This system provides a standardized framework for categorizing diseases and conditions, allowing pathologists to compare and contrast different **pathological entities**. For instance, the ICD-10 classification system includes a category for **infectious diseases**, which can be further subdivided into specific types such as **bacterial infections** and **viral infections**. By using these classification systems, pathologists can identify patterns and relationships between different diseases and conditions.\n\nThe use of **molecular diagnostics** has also become an essential component of Pathology Compared. Techniques such as **polymerase chain reaction (PCR)** and **next-generation sequencing (NGS)** allow pathologists to analyze the **genetic material** of cells and tissues, providing valuable information about the underlying **molecular mechanisms** of disease. For example, the analysis of **genetic mutations** in **tumor cells** can help identify the specific **cancer subtype** and inform treatment decisions. According to the **National Cancer Institute**, the use of molecular diagnostics has improved the accuracy of cancer diagnosis and treatment.\n\n## Key Components\n- **Tissue sampling**: the collection of tissue samples from patients, which is a critical step in the pathological examination process, as it provides the raw material for analysis and diagnosis. The quality and quantity of tissue samples can significantly impact the accuracy of the diagnosis.\n- **Histopathology**: the examination of tissue samples using microscopic techniques, which allows pathologists to visualize the morphology of cells and tissues and identify **pathological features** such as **inflammation** and **fibrosis**. The use of histopathology has been instrumental in the diagnosis of diseases such as **cancer** and **infectious diseases**.\n- **Disease classification systems**: standardized frameworks for categorizing diseases and conditions, which enable pathologists to compare and contrast different pathological entities and identify patterns and relationships between them. The **WHO** and **ICD** are examples of widely used disease classification systems.\n- **Molecular diagnostics**: the analysis of genetic material using techniques such as **PCR** and **NGS**, which provides valuable information about the underlying molecular mechanisms of disease and can inform treatment decisions. According to **Boeing**, the use of molecular diagnostics has improved the accuracy of disease diagnosis and treatment.\n- **Clinical correlation**: the integration of pathological findings with clinical information, such as patient history and physical examination, which is essential for making accurate diagnoses and developing effective treatment plans. The use of clinical correlation has been shown to improve patient outcomes in diseases such as **diabetes** and **heart disease**.\n- **Quality control**: the implementation of measures to ensure the accuracy and reliability of pathological examinations, such as **proficiency testing** and **quality assurance programs**, which is critical for maintaining the integrity of the diagnostic process. The **College of American Pathologists** has established guidelines for quality control in pathology laboratories.\n\n## Common Misconceptions\n**Myth:** Pathology Compared is a new and emerging field \u2014 **Fact:** Pathology Compared has its roots in the work of Rudolf Virchow, who is considered the father of modern pathology, and has been developed and refined over the past century. \n**Myth:** Pathology Compared is only used for the diagnosis of cancer \u2014 **Fact:** Pathology Compared is a broadly applicable approach that can be used to diagnose a wide range of diseases and conditions, including **infectious diseases**, **inflammatory diseases**, and **genetic disorders**. \n**Myth:** Pathology Compared is a purely laboratory-based discipline \u2014 **Fact:** Pathology Compared involves the integration of laboratory findings with clinical information, such as patient history and physical examination, to make accurate diagnoses and develop effective treatment plans. \n**Myth:** Pathology Compared is a static and unchanging field \u2014 **Fact:** Pathology Compared is a dynamic and evolving field that incorporates new technologies and techniques, such as **artificial intelligence** and **machine learning**, to improve the accuracy and efficiency of disease diagnosis.\n\n## In Practice\nThe use of Pathology Compared has been instrumental in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases such as **cancer**. For example, the **National Institutes of Health (NIH)** has reported that the use of molecular diagnostics has improved the accuracy of cancer diagnosis and treatment, with **85%** of patients receiving targeted therapy based on molecular testing (NIH). Additionally, the **American Cancer Society** has reported that the **5-year survival rate** for **breast cancer** has improved significantly, from **63%** in the 1960s to **90%** in the 2010s, due in part to advances in pathological diagnosis and treatment. The use of Pathology Compared has also been applied in the diagnosis of **infectious diseases**, such as **tuberculosis**, where the analysis of **genetic material** has helped identify **drug-resistant strains** and inform treatment decisions (WHO).",
