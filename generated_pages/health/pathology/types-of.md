# Types of Pathology

There are several categories of pathology, organized by the type of disease or condition being studied, including **Anatomical Pathology**, **Clinical Pathology**, **Molecular Pathology**, **Surgical Pathology**, and **Hematopathology**. 
**Anatomical Pathology** — the study of disease through examination of organs, tissues, and cells, characterized by the use of microscopy and histology, as seen in the work of the **National Cancer Institute**, which uses anatomical pathology to classify and diagnose cancer. 
**Clinical Pathology** — the study of disease through laboratory tests, characterized by the use of chemical and molecular analysis, as seen in the **Mayo Clinic**, which uses clinical pathology to diagnose and monitor diseases such as diabetes and kidney disease. 
**Molecular Pathology** — the study of disease at the molecular level, characterized by the use of techniques such as PCR and DNA sequencing, as seen in the **Human Genome Project**, which used molecular pathology to map the human genome. 
**Surgical Pathology** — the study of disease through examination of tissues and cells removed during surgery, characterized by the use of frozen section analysis and immunohistochemistry, as seen in the **Johns Hopkins Hospital**, which uses surgical pathology to diagnose and treat diseases such as cancer. 
**Hematopathology** — the study of blood and blood-related diseases, characterized by the use of techniques such as flow cytometry and cytogenetics, as seen in the **National Institutes of Health**, which uses hematopathology to study and treat diseases such as leukemia.

## Main Categories
- **Anatomical Pathology** involves the examination of organs, tissues, and cells to diagnose disease, with the **National Cancer Institute** serving as a prominent example, where anatomical pathology is used to classify and diagnose cancer, including the use of techniques such as histology and microscopy to examine tissue samples.
- **Clinical Pathology** involves the use of laboratory tests to diagnose and monitor disease, with the **Mayo Clinic** serving as a prominent example, where clinical pathology is used to diagnose and monitor diseases such as diabetes and kidney disease, including the use of techniques such as chemical and molecular analysis to examine blood and other bodily fluids.
- **Molecular Pathology** involves the study of disease at the molecular level, with the **Human Genome Project** serving as a prominent example, where molecular pathology was used to map the human genome, including the use of techniques such as PCR and DNA sequencing to examine genetic material.
- **Surgical Pathology** involves the examination of tissues and cells removed during surgery to diagnose disease, with the **Johns Hopkins Hospital** serving as a prominent example, where surgical pathology is used to diagnose and treat diseases such as cancer, including the use of techniques such as frozen section analysis and immunohistochemistry to examine tissue samples.
- **Hematopathology** involves the study of blood and blood-related diseases, with the **National Institutes of Health** serving as a prominent example, where hematopathology is used to study and treat diseases such as leukemia, including the use of techniques such as flow cytometry and cytogenetics to examine blood cells.

## Comparison Table
| Category | Cost | Scale | Speed | Risk |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Anatomical Pathology** | High | Large | Slow | Low |
| **Clinical Pathology** | Medium | Medium | Medium | Medium |
| **Molecular Pathology** | High | Small | Fast | High |
| **Surgical Pathology** | High | Large | Fast | High |
| **Hematopathology** | Medium | Small | Medium | Medium |

## How They Relate
**Anatomical Pathology** and **Surgical Pathology** are closely related, as both involve the examination of tissues and cells to diagnose disease, with **Surgical Pathology** often building on the findings of **Anatomical Pathology** to inform treatment decisions, as seen in the case of cancer diagnosis and treatment. 
**Clinical Pathology** and **Molecular Pathology** are also related, as both involve the use of laboratory tests to diagnose and monitor disease, with **Molecular Pathology** often providing more detailed information about the molecular mechanisms underlying disease, as seen in the case of genetic testing for inherited diseases. 
**Hematopathology** is related to **Anatomical Pathology** and **Clinical Pathology**, as all three involve the examination of blood and blood-related tissues to diagnose disease, with **Hematopathology** providing specialized expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of blood-related diseases, as seen in the case of leukemia diagnosis and treatment. 
The categories are not mutually exclusive, and many diseases are diagnosed and treated using a combination of approaches, such as **Anatomical Pathology** and **Clinical Pathology**, or **Molecular Pathology** and **Hematopathology**. 
For example, the diagnosis of cancer often involves a combination of **Anatomical Pathology**, **Surgical Pathology**, and **Molecular Pathology**, while the diagnosis of leukemia often involves a combination of **Hematopathology**, **Clinical Pathology**, and **Molecular Pathology**.
