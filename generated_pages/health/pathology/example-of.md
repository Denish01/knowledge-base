# Example of Pathology

## Definition
Pathology is the medical discipline that studies diseases, their causes, and their effects on the body, founded on the principles of **anatomical pathology** by Rudolf Virchow in 1858.

## How It Works
The field of pathology involves the examination of tissues, cells, and bodily fluids to diagnose and understand diseases. Pathologists use various techniques, including **histopathology**, which involves the study of tissue under a microscope, and **cytopathology**, which involves the study of cells. According to the College of American Pathologists, there are approximately 18,000 board-certified pathologists in the United States, with the majority working in hospital laboratories (College of American Pathologists).

The process of pathological examination typically begins with the collection of a tissue or fluid sample from a patient, which is then sent to a laboratory for analysis. The sample is then processed and examined using various techniques, such as **immunohistochemistry**, which uses antibodies to detect specific proteins in tissue samples. The results of the examination are then used to diagnose and manage diseases, with pathologists working closely with other healthcare professionals, such as clinicians and radiologists, to provide accurate and timely diagnoses. For example, the **World Health Organization** reports that the global burden of cancer is increasing, with an estimated 19.3 million new cases and 10.0 million deaths in 2020 (World Health Organization).

The field of pathology is constantly evolving, with advances in technology and new discoveries leading to improved diagnostic techniques and treatments. For instance, the use of **molecular pathology** has enabled the detection of specific genetic mutations in cancer cells, allowing for more targeted and effective treatments. The **National Cancer Institute** estimates that the use of molecular testing in cancer diagnosis has increased significantly, with approximately 70% of cancer patients undergoing molecular testing in 2020 (National Cancer Institute).

## Key Components
- **Gross examination**: involves the visual examination of tissues and organs to identify any abnormalities, with changes in tissue appearance or texture indicating potential disease.
- **Microscopic examination**: involves the use of a microscope to examine tissues and cells, with changes in cellular structure or function indicating potential disease.
- **Molecular testing**: involves the use of techniques such as **polymerase chain reaction (PCR)** to detect specific genetic mutations or abnormalities, with changes in molecular profiles indicating potential disease.
- **Immunohistochemistry**: involves the use of antibodies to detect specific proteins in tissue samples, with changes in protein expression indicating potential disease.
- **Cytopathology**: involves the examination of cells to diagnose diseases, with changes in cellular morphology or function indicating potential disease.
- **Telepathology**: involves the use of digital technology to transmit and examine pathological images, with changes in image quality or transmission speed affecting diagnostic accuracy.

## Common Misconceptions
**Myth:** Pathology is only concerned with the diagnosis of diseases — **Fact:** Pathology also involves the study of disease mechanisms and the development of new treatments, as demonstrated by the work of **Rosalind Franklin**, who used X-ray crystallography to study the structure of DNA (Rosalind Franklin).
**Myth:** Pathologists only work in laboratories — **Fact:** Pathologists work in a variety of settings, including hospitals, research institutions, and private practice, with approximately 30% of pathologists working in academic or research positions (College of American Pathologists).
**Myth:** Pathology is a static field — **Fact:** Pathology is a rapidly evolving field, with advances in technology and new discoveries leading to improved diagnostic techniques and treatments, as demonstrated by the development of **next-generation sequencing** (National Institutes of Health).

## In Practice
The **University of California, San Francisco** has a comprehensive pathology department that provides a range of diagnostic services, including **histopathology** and **cytopathology**. The department uses advanced techniques, such as **immunohistochemistry** and **molecular testing**, to diagnose and manage diseases, with a team of approximately 100 pathologists and laboratory professionals working together to provide accurate and timely diagnoses. According to the **American Cancer Society**, the use of molecular testing in cancer diagnosis has improved significantly, with approximately 50% of cancer patients undergoing molecular testing in 2020 (American Cancer Society).
