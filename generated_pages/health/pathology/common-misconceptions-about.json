  "content": "The most common misconception about pathology is that it solely focuses on disease diagnosis after death, which is not entirely accurate. \n## Misconceptions\n- **Myth:** Pathology is only concerned with performing autopsies to determine the cause of death.\n- **Fact:** Pathologists examine tissues and cells to diagnose diseases, with approximately 70% of medical decisions relying on laboratory results, such as **histopathology** and **cytopathology** (College of American Pathologists).\n- **Source of confusion:** This myth persists due to the media narrative often portraying pathologists as solely performing autopsies, as seen in popular TV shows like CSI.\n\n- **Myth:** Pathologists only work in laboratories and do not interact with patients.\n- **Fact:** Many pathologists, such as **surgical pathologists** and **cytopathologists**, work closely with clinicians to provide diagnoses and discuss treatment options, with some even conducting **fine-needle aspirations** and **bone marrow biopsies** (American Society for Clinical Pathology).\n- **Source of confusion:** This misconception arises from the lack of visibility of pathologists in clinical settings, as their work is often behind the scenes.\n\n- **Myth:** Molecular testing is a recent development in pathology.\n- **Fact:** Molecular diagnostics have been used in pathology for decades, with techniques like **PCR** and **FISH** being employed since the 1980s to diagnose genetic disorders and cancers (National Institutes of Health).\n- **Source of confusion:** The rapid advancement of genetic sequencing technologies has led to the misconception that molecular testing is a new field, when in fact it has a long history in pathology.\n\n- **Myth:** Pathology is a low-tech field that does not require advanced technology.\n- **Fact:** Pathology relies heavily on advanced technologies, including **digital pathology** and **artificial intelligence**, to analyze images and diagnose diseases, with companies like **Leica Biosystems** and **Roche** developing innovative solutions (Leica Biosystems annual report).\n- **Source of confusion:** The misconception that pathology is low-tech stems from the fact that many people associate the field with traditional microscope-based diagnosis, rather than recognizing its rapid technological advancements.\n\n- **Myth:** Pathologists are not involved in preventive medicine.\n- **Fact:** Pathologists play a crucial role in preventive medicine by identifying risk factors and developing screening programs for diseases like cancer, with **pap smear** screening reducing cervical cancer incidence by 70% (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).\n- **Source of confusion:** This myth persists due to the common perception that pathologists are only concerned with disease diagnosis, rather than prevention.\n\n- **Myth:** Pathology is not a significant contributor to medical research.\n- **Fact:** Pathologists have made significant contributions to medical research, including the discovery of the **HPV vaccine** and the development of **immunotherapy** for cancer treatment (National Cancer Institute).\n- **Source of confusion:** The misconception that pathology is not a major contributor to medical research arises from the fact that many people associate medical research with clinical trials and basic science, rather than recognizing the critical role of pathology in understanding disease mechanisms.\n\n## Quick Reference\n- Myth: Pathology is only concerned with autopsies \u2192 Fact: 70% of medical decisions rely on laboratory results like histopathology and cytopathology (College of American Pathologists)\n- Myth: Pathologists do not interact with patients \u2192 Fact: Surgical pathologists and cytopathologists work closely with clinicians to provide diagnoses and discuss treatment options (American Society for Clinical Pathology)\n- Myth: Molecular testing is a recent development \u2192 Fact: Molecular diagnostics have been used in pathology for decades, with techniques like PCR and FISH being employed since the 1980s (National Institutes of Health)\n- Myth: Pathology is a low-tech field \u2192 Fact: Pathology relies heavily on advanced technologies like digital pathology and artificial intelligence (Leica Biosystems annual report)\n- Myth: Pathologists are not involved in preventive medicine \u2192 Fact: Pathologists identify risk factors and develop screening programs for diseases like cancer, with pap smear screening reducing cervical cancer incidence by 70% (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)\n- Myth: Pathology is not a significant contributor to medical research \u2192 Fact: Pathologists have made significant contributions to medical research, including the discovery of the HPV vaccine and the development of immunotherapy for cancer treatment (National Cancer Institute)",
