# What Infectious Diseases Depends On

**Immunization** is the most critical dependency for preventing the spread of infectious diseases, as it directly reduces the number of susceptible individuals in a population, thereby breaking the chain of transmission. 
Without **immunization**, diseases like measles and polio can spread rapidly, as seen in the 2019 measles outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where low vaccination rates contributed to over 6,000 reported cases and 200 deaths (World Health Organization).
Other critical dependencies include:
- **Sanitation**, which prevents the spread of diseases like cholera and typhoid fever through contaminated water and food, as evidenced by the 1854 cholera outbreak in London, where poor sanitation led to over 600 deaths
- **Vector control**, which reduces the spread of diseases like malaria and dengue fever through mosquitoes, as seen in the 2015-2016 Zika virus outbreak in Brazil, where inadequate vector control measures contributed to over 2,000 reported cases of congenital Zika syndrome
- **Antibiotics**, which treat bacterial infections like tuberculosis and pneumonia, as demonstrated by the rise of antibiotic-resistant tuberculosis in countries with poor access to effective antibiotics, such as in the former Soviet Union
- **Contact tracing**, which identifies and isolates individuals who have come into contact with an infected person, as illustrated by the 2003 SARS outbreak in Toronto, where effective contact tracing helped contain the spread of the disease
- **Public health infrastructure**, which provides the foundation for disease surveillance, outbreak response, and healthcare delivery, as seen in the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, where weak public health infrastructure hindered the response to the outbreak

## Priority Order
The dependencies can be ranked in order of priority as follows:
- **Immunization**, as it provides direct protection against infectious diseases and is often the most effective way to prevent outbreaks
- **Sanitation**, as it prevents the spread of diseases through contaminated water and food, and is critical for maintaining public health
- **Vector control**, as it reduces the spread of diseases through mosquitoes and other vectors, and is essential for controlling outbreaks
- **Antibiotics**, as they treat bacterial infections and are critical for preventing the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria
- **Contact tracing**, as it identifies and isolates individuals who have come into contact with an infected person, and is essential for containing outbreaks
- **Public health infrastructure**, as it provides the foundation for disease surveillance, outbreak response, and healthcare delivery, and is critical for maintaining public health

## Common Gaps
People often overlook or take for granted the importance of **sanitation** and **vector control**, assuming that these are already in place or that they are not critical for preventing the spread of infectious diseases. 
However, the assumption that **sanitation** is already adequate can lead to failures like the 2010 cholera outbreak in Haiti, where poor sanitation contributed to over 9,000 reported cases and 800 deaths. 
Similarly, the assumption that **vector control** is not necessary can lead to failures like the 2015-2016 Zika virus outbreak in Brazil, where inadequate vector control measures contributed to over 2,000 reported cases of congenital Zika syndrome. 
These assumptions can have serious consequences, including the spread of infectious diseases and significant morbidity and mortality.
