# Types of Infectious Diseases

There are four primary categories of infectious diseases, organized by their causative agents: bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic. 
## Main Categories
- **Bacterial Diseases** — caused by single-celled microorganisms, often treatable with antibiotics, exemplified by **Tuberculosis**, which is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis and affects millions worldwide, including a notable outbreak in **New York City** in the early 1990s.
- **Viral Diseases** — caused by obligate parasites that require a host cell to replicate, often treated with antiviral medications, exemplified by **Influenza**, which is caused by the influenza virus and results in approximately 500,000 deaths annually (World Health Organization), with notable outbreaks like the **1918 Spanish Flu**.
- **Fungal Diseases** — caused by eukaryotic organisms that obtain their nutrients by decomposing organic material or forming parasitic relationships with other organisms, often treated with antifungal medications, exemplified by **Candidiasis**, which is caused by Candida albicans and can lead to life-threatening conditions in immunocompromised patients, such as those with **HIV/AIDS**.
- **Parasitic Diseases** — caused by organisms that live on or in a host and feed off the host, often treated with antiparasitic medications, exemplified by **Malaria**, which is caused by Plasmodium parasites transmitted through the bite of an infected **Anopheles** mosquito and results in hundreds of thousands of deaths annually, primarily in **Sub-Saharan Africa**.

## Comparison Table
| Category | Transmission Method | Treatment Options | Mortality Rate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Bacterial Diseases | Direct contact, contaminated food/water, airborne | Antibiotics, supportive care | 10-20% (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) |
| Viral Diseases | Direct contact, airborne, vector-borne | Antiviral medications, supportive care, vaccination | 1-50% (World Health Organization) |
| Fungal Diseases | Direct contact, contaminated environment, opportunistic infection | Antifungal medications, supportive care | 10-90% (National Institutes of Health) |
| Parasitic Diseases | Vector-borne, contaminated food/water, direct contact | Antiparasitic medications, supportive care | 5-50% (World Health Organization) |

## How They Relate
The categories of infectious diseases often overlap, as a single disease can be caused by multiple types of pathogens, or a single pathogen can cause multiple diseases. For example, **Pneumonia** can be caused by both bacterial and viral pathogens, and **HIV/AIDS** can increase the risk of developing fungal and parasitic diseases. Additionally, bacterial and viral diseases can be commonly confused due to similar symptoms, such as **Influenza** and **Pneumococcal disease**, which can both present with respiratory symptoms. Fungal and parasitic diseases are often misdiagnosed due to their nonspecific symptoms and the lack of routine testing, as seen in cases of **Coccidioidomycosis** and **Chagas disease**. Understanding the relationships between these categories is crucial for accurate diagnosis and effective treatment of infectious diseases.
