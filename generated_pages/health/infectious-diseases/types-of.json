  "content": "There are four primary categories of infectious diseases, organized by their causative agents: bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic. \n## Main Categories\n- **Bacterial Diseases** \u2014 caused by single-celled microorganisms, often treatable with antibiotics, exemplified by **Tuberculosis**, which is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis and affects millions worldwide, including a notable outbreak in **New York City** in the early 1990s.\n- **Viral Diseases** \u2014 caused by obligate parasites that require a host cell to replicate, often treated with antiviral medications, exemplified by **Influenza**, which is caused by the influenza virus and results in approximately 500,000 deaths annually (World Health Organization), with notable outbreaks like the **1918 Spanish Flu**.\n- **Fungal Diseases** \u2014 caused by eukaryotic organisms that obtain their nutrients by decomposing organic material or forming parasitic relationships with other organisms, often treated with antifungal medications, exemplified by **Candidiasis**, which is caused by Candida albicans and can lead to life-threatening conditions in immunocompromised patients, such as those with **HIV/AIDS**.\n- **Parasitic Diseases** \u2014 caused by organisms that live on or in a host and feed off the host, often treated with antiparasitic medications, exemplified by **Malaria**, which is caused by Plasmodium parasites transmitted through the bite of an infected **Anopheles** mosquito and results in hundreds of thousands of deaths annually, primarily in **Sub-Saharan Africa**.\n\n## Comparison Table\n| Category | Transmission Method | Treatment Options | Mortality Rate |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Bacterial Diseases | Direct contact, contaminated food/water, airborne | Antibiotics, supportive care | 10-20% (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) |\n| Viral Diseases | Direct contact, airborne, vector-borne | Antiviral medications, supportive care, vaccination | 1-50% (World Health Organization) |\n| Fungal Diseases | Direct contact, contaminated environment, opportunistic infection | Antifungal medications, supportive care | 10-90% (National Institutes of Health) |\n| Parasitic Diseases | Vector-borne, contaminated food/water, direct contact | Antiparasitic medications, supportive care | 5-50% (World Health Organization) |\n\n## How They Relate\nThe categories of infectious diseases often overlap, as a single disease can be caused by multiple types of pathogens, or a single pathogen can cause multiple diseases. For example, **Pneumonia** can be caused by both bacterial and viral pathogens, and **HIV/AIDS** can increase the risk of developing fungal and parasitic diseases. Additionally, bacterial and viral diseases can be commonly confused due to similar symptoms, such as **Influenza** and **Pneumococcal disease**, which can both present with respiratory symptoms. Fungal and parasitic diseases are often misdiagnosed due to their nonspecific symptoms and the lack of routine testing, as seen in cases of **Coccidioidomycosis** and **Chagas disease**. Understanding the relationships between these categories is crucial for accurate diagnosis and effective treatment of infectious diseases.",
