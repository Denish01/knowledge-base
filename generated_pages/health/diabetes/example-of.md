# Example of Diabetes

## Definition
Diabetes is a group of metabolic disorders characterized by high blood sugar levels, first described by **Elliott Joslin** in 1921.

## How It Works
Diabetes results from the body's inability to produce enough **insulin**, a hormone produced by the pancreas that regulates blood sugar levels. The pancreas produces two main types of cells: **alpha cells**, which produce **glucagon**, a hormone that raises blood sugar levels, and **beta cells**, which produce **insulin**. When **beta cells** are damaged or not functioning properly, the body is unable to produce enough **insulin**, leading to high blood sugar levels. According to the **World Health Organization**, approximately 463 million people worldwide suffer from diabetes, with **Type 2 diabetes** accounting for around 90% of all cases.

The development of diabetes is influenced by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, including **obesity**, **physical inactivity**, and an unhealthy diet. **The American Diabetes Association** recommends that individuals with diabetes aim to maintain a **hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level** of less than 7% to minimize the risk of complications. The **UK Prospective Diabetes Study** found that intensive blood glucose control can reduce the risk of complications, such as **kidney disease** and **blindness**, by up to 25% (UK Prospective Diabetes Study Group).

The management of diabetes involves a range of treatments, including **lifestyle modifications**, such as diet and exercise, and **medications**, such as **metformin** and **sulfonylureas**. **The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention** estimate that the annual cost of diabetes in the United States is around $327 billion, with **medical expenses** accounting for around 80% of this total. **The International Diabetes Federation** reports that the global cost of diabetes is around $1.3 trillion annually, with **China** and **India** accounting for around 40% of all cases.

## Key Components
- **Insulin resistance**: a condition in which the body's cells become less responsive to insulin, leading to high blood sugar levels. As insulin resistance increases, the risk of developing **Type 2 diabetes** also increases.
- **Beta cell function**: the ability of the pancreas to produce insulin. When beta cell function decreases, the body is unable to produce enough insulin, leading to high blood sugar levels.
- **Glucose metabolism**: the process by which the body converts glucose into energy. Impaired glucose metabolism is a key feature of diabetes.
- **Kidney function**: the ability of the kidneys to filter waste and excess fluids from the blood. Diabetes can damage the kidneys, leading to **kidney disease**.
- **Nerve function**: the ability of the nerves to transmit signals to and from the brain. Diabetes can damage the nerves, leading to **nerve damage**.
- **Eye health**: the ability of the eyes to function properly. Diabetes can damage the eyes, leading to **blindness**.

## Common Misconceptions
**Myth:** Diabetes is caused by eating too much sugar — **Fact:** While a high-sugar diet can contribute to the development of diabetes, it is not the sole cause (American Diabetes Association).
**Myth:** Only older people get diabetes — **Fact:** While the risk of developing diabetes increases with age, **Type 2 diabetes** can occur at any age, and **Type 1 diabetes** typically develops in children and young adults (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).
**Myth:** Diabetes is not a serious disease — **Fact:** Diabetes can lead to serious complications, such as **kidney disease**, **blindness**, and **amputations**, if left untreated or poorly managed (World Health Organization).
**Myth:** There is a cure for diabetes — **Fact:** While there are treatments available to manage diabetes, there is currently no cure for the disease (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases).

## In Practice
In **China**, the number of people with diabetes has increased dramatically in recent decades, with around 140 million people currently affected. The **Chinese government** has implemented a range of initiatives to tackle the disease, including **public awareness campaigns** and **screening programs**. **Novo Nordisk**, a Danish pharmaceutical company, has partnered with the **Chinese government** to provide **insulin** and other diabetes treatments to patients in **China**. The company estimates that around 50% of people with diabetes in **China** are not receiving adequate treatment, highlighting the need for increased access to care and education.
