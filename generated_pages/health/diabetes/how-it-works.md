# How Diabetes Works

Diabetes is a metabolic disorder caused by the body's inability to produce or effectively use **insulin**, a hormone that regulates **blood glucose** levels, resulting in high blood sugar levels that can damage organs and tissues over time. The core cause-and-effect chain of diabetes involves the ingestion of **carbohydrates**, which are broken down into **glucose** and absorbed into the bloodstream, triggering the release of **insulin** from the **pancreas**, which then facilitates the uptake of **glucose** by cells throughout the body.

## The Mechanism
The mechanism of diabetes is centered around the regulation of **blood glucose** levels by **insulin**, with the **pancreas** producing approximately 50 units of **insulin** per day (American Diabetes Association) to manage the body's **glucose** intake. When **insulin** is absent or ineffective, **blood glucose** levels rise, causing damage to organs and tissues, such as the **kidneys**, which filter approximately 180 liters of blood per day (National Kidney Foundation).

## Step-by-Step
1. **Glucose ingestion**: When an individual consumes **carbohydrates**, such as a slice of white bread containing 30 grams of **carbohydrates**, the body breaks them down into **glucose**, which is then absorbed into the bloodstream, causing **blood glucose** levels to rise by approximately 20-30 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).
2. **Insulin release**: In response to the increase in **blood glucose** levels, the **pancreas** releases **insulin**, with a typical adult producing around 2-3 units of **insulin** per kilogram of body weight per day (Joslin Diabetes Center), which then binds to **insulin receptors** on the surface of cells, facilitating the uptake of **glucose**.
3. **Glucose uptake**: As **insulin** binds to **insulin receptors**, it triggers a signaling cascade that ultimately leads to the insertion of **glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4)** proteins into the cell membrane, allowing **glucose** to enter the cell, with approximately 80% of **glucose** being taken up by **skeletal muscle** cells (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases).
4. **Glycogen synthesis**: Once inside the cell, **glucose** is converted into **glycogen**, a complex carbohydrate stored in the **liver** and **muscle** cells, with the **liver** storing approximately 100 grams of **glycogen** per kilogram of body weight (Harvard Health Publishing).
5. **Glucose metabolism**: As **glucose** is metabolized, it is converted into **energy** in the form of **ATP**, with approximately 36-38 ATP molecules produced per **glucose** molecule (Krebs cycle), which is then used to power the body's various functions, such as **muscle contraction** and **nerve impulses**.
6. **Blood glucose regulation**: The body's **blood glucose** levels are tightly regulated by the balance between **glucose** intake and **insulin** release, with the **pancreas** adjusting **insulin** production in response to changes in **blood glucose** levels, aiming to maintain a **blood glucose** level of approximately 70-110 mg/dL (American Diabetes Association).

## Key Components
- **Pancreas**: produces **insulin** and **glucagon**, hormones that regulate **blood glucose** levels, with the **islets of Langerhans** containing approximately 1 million **beta cells** responsible for **insulin** production (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases).
- **Insulin receptors**: found on the surface of cells, these receptors bind to **insulin**, triggering a signaling cascade that facilitates **glucose** uptake, with approximately 200,000 **insulin receptors** per cell (Joslin Diabetes Center).
- **Glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4)**: a protein that inserts into the cell membrane in response to **insulin** binding, allowing **glucose** to enter the cell, with approximately 10,000 **GLUT4** proteins per cell (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases).
- **Liver**: stores **glycogen** and releases **glucose** into the bloodstream when **blood glucose** levels are low, with the **liver** storing approximately 100 grams of **glycogen** per kilogram of body weight (Harvard Health Publishing).

## Common Questions
What happens if the **pancreas** fails to produce **insulin**? The body's **blood glucose** levels will rise, causing damage to organs and tissues, such as the **kidneys**, which filter approximately 180 liters of blood per day (National Kidney Foundation). 
What is the role of **diet** in managing **blood glucose** levels? A healthy **diet** that is low in **carbohydrates** and high in **fiber** can help regulate **blood glucose** levels, with the American Diabetes Association recommending a daily intake of 25-30 grams of **fiber** (American Diabetes Association). 
How does **exercise** affect **blood glucose** levels? Regular **exercise**, such as **aerobic exercise**, can improve **insulin sensitivity**, allowing **glucose** to enter cells more efficiently, with approximately 30 minutes of **aerobic exercise** per day recommended (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). 
What are the complications of **diabetes** if left untreated? Untreated **diabetes** can lead to serious complications, including **kidney failure**, **blindness**, and **nerve damage**, with approximately 30% of individuals with **diabetes** developing **kidney disease** (National Kidney Foundation).
