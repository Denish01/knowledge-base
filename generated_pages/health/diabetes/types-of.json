  "content": "There are four main categories of diabetes, classified based on the underlying causes and characteristics of the disease. \n## Main Categories\n- **Type 1 Diabetes** \u2014 an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system attacks and destroys the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas, characterized by high blood glucose levels and requiring insulin therapy, as seen in the case of **Nick Jonas**, who was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at the age of 13.\n- **Type 2 Diabetes** \u2014 a metabolic disorder in which the body becomes resistant to insulin, often due to a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors, such as obesity and physical inactivity, as exemplified by the **Diabetes Prevention Program**, which aims to prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes through lifestyle changes.\n- **Gestational Diabetes** \u2014 a condition that develops during pregnancy, typically in the second or third trimester, and is characterized by high blood glucose levels, as seen in the case of **Khloe Kardashian**, who was diagnosed with gestational diabetes during her pregnancy.\n- **LADA (Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults)** \u2014 a form of type 1 diabetes that develops in adults, often after the age of 30, and is characterized by a gradual decline in insulin production, as seen in the case of **Steve Redgrave**, a British rower who was diagnosed with LADA at the age of 35.\n\n## Comparison Table\n| Category | Age of Onset | Insulin Dependence | Risk Factors |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Type 1 Diabetes | Typically before age 20 | High | Family history, genetic predisposition |\n| Type 2 Diabetes | Typically after age 45 | Variable | Obesity, physical inactivity, family history |\n| Gestational Diabetes | During pregnancy | Variable | Obesity, family history, previous history of gestational diabetes |\n| LADA | Typically after age 30 | High | Family history, genetic predisposition |\n\n## How They Relate\nThe categories of diabetes can overlap, and some individuals may exhibit characteristics of multiple types. For example, **Type 1 Diabetes** and **LADA** are both characterized by an autoimmune destruction of beta cells, but they differ in the age of onset and the rate of progression. **Type 2 Diabetes** and **Gestational Diabetes** share some common risk factors, such as obesity and physical inactivity, but they have distinct underlying causes and characteristics. **Gestational Diabetes** can increase the risk of developing **Type 2 Diabetes** later in life, and **LADA** can be misdiagnosed as **Type 2 Diabetes** due to its slower progression. Understanding the relationships between these categories is crucial for accurate diagnosis and effective management of the disease.",
