# What Is Diabetes?

## Definition
Diabetes is a group of metabolic disorders characterized by high blood sugar levels, first described by **Aretaeus of Cappadocia** in the 2nd century AD.

## How It Works
Diabetes results from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both, leading to elevated blood glucose levels. Insulin, produced by the **pancreas**, regulates blood sugar levels by facilitating glucose uptake in cells. In **Type 1 diabetes**, the immune system destroys the insulin-producing **beta cells** in the pancreas, resulting in a complete deficiency of insulin production. In contrast, **Type 2 diabetes** is characterized by insulin resistance, where the body's cells become less responsive to insulin, and impaired insulin secretion, often due to **beta cell** dysfunction. The **World Health Organization** estimates that approximately 463 million adults worldwide have diabetes, with this number expected to increase to 578 million by 2030 (International Diabetes Federation).

The development of diabetes is influenced by **genetic** and **environmental factors**, such as obesity, physical inactivity, and an unhealthy diet. For example, the **Framingham Heart Study** found that individuals with a family history of diabetes are more likely to develop the disease. Additionally, research by **Booth et al.** has shown that a diet high in saturated fats and low in fiber can contribute to insulin resistance. The **American Diabetes Association** recommends a healthy diet and regular physical activity to prevent or manage diabetes.

Diabetes can lead to serious complications, including **cardiovascular disease**, **nephropathy**, and **neuropathy**. The **United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study** demonstrated that tight blood glucose control can reduce the risk of these complications. Furthermore, **Klein et al.** found that intensive glucose control can reduce the risk of **macrovascular events**, such as heart attacks and strokes, by 42%. The **Centers for Disease Control and Prevention** estimate that the total annual cost of diabetes in the United States is approximately $327 billion.

## Key Components
- **Insulin**: regulates blood sugar levels by facilitating glucose uptake in cells; decreased insulin production or sensitivity can lead to hyperglycemia
- **Glucose**: the primary source of energy for cells; elevated glucose levels can damage tissues and organs
- **Pancreas**: produces insulin and glucagon, hormones that regulate blood sugar levels; dysfunction or damage to the pancreas can lead to diabetes
- **Beta cells**: produce insulin in the pancreas; destruction or dysfunction of beta cells can lead to diabetes
- **Insulin resistance**: a condition in which the body's cells become less responsive to insulin, leading to elevated blood glucose levels; increased physical activity and weight loss can improve insulin sensitivity
- **Hemoglobin A1c**: a measure of average blood glucose levels over the past 2-3 months; used to diagnose and monitor diabetes, with a level of 6.5% or higher indicating diabetes (American Diabetes Association)

## Common Misconceptions
**Myth:** Diabetes is a single disease — **Fact:** Diabetes is a group of metabolic disorders, including **Type 1**, **Type 2**, **gestational diabetes**, and **latent autoimmune diabetes in adults** (LADA)
**Myth:** Only older adults can develop diabetes — **Fact:** Diabetes can occur at any age, with **Type 1 diabetes** often developing in children and young adults
**Myth:** Diabetes is caused by eating too much sugar — **Fact:** While a diet high in sugar can contribute to insulin resistance, diabetes is a complex disease influenced by **genetic** and **environmental factors**, including obesity and physical inactivity
**Myth:** People with diabetes must follow a very restrictive diet — **Fact:** While a healthy diet is essential for managing diabetes, people with diabetes can eat a **balanced diet** that includes a variety of foods, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins (Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics)

## In Practice
In the United States, the **Centers for Disease Control and Prevention** estimate that approximately 34 million adults have diabetes, with total annual costs of $327 billion. The **Medicare program** spends approximately $1 billion annually on diabetes-related care, with **Novo Nordisk** and **Eli Lilly** being leading manufacturers of diabetes medications, such as **insulin** and **metformin**. In 2020, **Novo Nordisk** reported sales of $7.4 billion for its diabetes care products, with **Eli Lilly** reporting sales of $4.6 billion for its diabetes products. The **American Diabetes Association** recommends that people with diabetes work with their healthcare providers to develop a personalized plan for managing their condition, including a healthy diet, regular physical activity, and medication as needed.
