  "content": "Obesity is the single biggest factor affecting diabetes, as excess body fat increases insulin resistance, with a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) showing that approximately 39.6% of adults in the United States have obesity, which increases their risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 7 times (CDC National Diabetes Statistics Report).\n\n## Main Factors\n- **Genetics** \u2014 inherited traits can increase the risk of developing diabetes, particularly in individuals with a family history of the disease, with a study by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) showing that having a first-degree relative with type 2 diabetes increases an individual's risk by 2-6 times, such as the Pima Indians, who have a high prevalence of type 2 diabetes due to their genetic predisposition, with approximately 37% of the population developing the disease by age 35 (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases).\n- **Physical inactivity** \u2014 lack of exercise decreases insulin sensitivity, with the World Health Organization (WHO) recommending at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity per week to reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, such as a study by the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), which found that individuals who engaged in regular physical activity had a 31% lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared to those who did not (UCLA Department of Medicine).\n- **Diet** \u2014 consuming high amounts of sugar and saturated fats increases insulin resistance, with the American Heart Association (AHA) recommending that women consume no more than 25 grams of added sugars per day and men consume no more than 36 grams per day, such as a study by the Harvard School of Public Health, which found that drinking one or two sugary drinks per day increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 26% (Harvard School of Public Health).\n- **Age** \u2014 risk of developing diabetes increases with age, particularly after the age of 45, with the CDC showing that approximately 25% of adults in the United States aged 65 and older have diabetes, such as a study by the National Institute on Aging (NIA), which found that the risk of developing type 2 diabetes increases by 10% per decade after the age of 45 (NIA).\n- **Ethnicity** \u2014 certain ethnic groups, such as African Americans, Hispanics, and American Indians, are at a higher risk of developing diabetes due to genetic and environmental factors, with the CDC showing that approximately 16.4% of African Americans and 22.6% of American Indians have diabetes, such as a study by the University of Michigan, which found that African Americans have a 77% higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared to non-Hispanic whites (University of Michigan Department of Medicine).\n- **Socioeconomic status** \u2014 low-income individuals have limited access to healthy food and healthcare, increasing their risk of developing diabetes, with a study by the CDC showing that approximately 18.4% of adults in the United States with a household income below $35,000 have diabetes, such as a study by the University of California, Berkeley, which found that individuals with a lower socioeconomic status have a 25% higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared to those with a higher socioeconomic status (University of California, Berkeley Department of Public Health).\n- **Hypertension** \u2014 high blood pressure increases the risk of developing diabetes, particularly in individuals with a family history of the disease, with the AHA showing that approximately 67% of adults in the United States with hypertension have an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, such as a study by the University of Chicago, which found that individuals with hypertension have a 2.5 times higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared to those without hypertension (University of Chicago Department of Medicine).\n\n## How They Interact\nThe interaction between **physical inactivity** and **diet** amplifies the risk of developing diabetes, as a diet high in sugar and saturated fats can further decrease insulin sensitivity in individuals who do not engage in regular physical activity, such as a study by the University of Texas, which found that individuals who consumed a high-fat diet and did not engage in regular physical activity had a 55% higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared to those who consumed a low-fat diet and engaged in regular physical activity (University of Texas Department of Nutrition). The interaction between **age** and **genetics** also increases the risk of developing diabetes, as the risk of developing the disease increases with age, particularly in individuals with a family history of the disease, such as a study by the National Institute on Aging (NIA), which found that individuals with a family history of type 2 diabetes have a 3.5 times higher risk of developing the disease after the age of 45 (NIA). The interaction between **socioeconomic status** and **access to healthcare** also affects the risk of developing diabetes, as low-income individuals with limited access to healthcare are more likely to develop complications from the disease, such as a study by the CDC, which found that individuals with a lower socioeconomic status have a 30% higher risk of developing complications from type 2 diabetes compared to those with a higher socioeconomic status (CDC).\n\n## Controllable vs Uncontrollable\nThe controllable factors affecting diabetes include **diet**, **physical activity**, and **socioeconomic status**, which can be controlled by individuals through healthy lifestyle choices, such as consuming a balanced diet, engaging in regular physical activity, and seeking access to healthcare and education, such as a study by the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), which found that individuals who made healthy lifestyle choices had a 45% lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared to those who did not (UCLA Department of Medicine). The uncontrollable factors affecting diabetes include **genetics**, **age**, **ethnicity**, and **hypertension**, which are influenced by genetic and environmental factors outside of an individual's control, such as a study by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, which found that individuals with a family history of type 2 diabetes have a 2-6 times higher risk of developing the disease (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases).",
