# What Pharmacology Depends On

Pharmacology depends on **Biochemistry**, as understanding the chemical properties of drugs and their interactions with biological systems is crucial for developing effective and safe medications, and the lack of biochemistry knowledge led to the disastrous launch of thalidomide in the 1950s, which caused severe birth defects due to its teratogenic effects.

## Key Dependencies
- **Toxicology** — understanding the adverse effects of drugs on living organisms is necessary to ensure safe dosages and minimize harm, and the absence of toxicology considerations led to the Elixir Sulfanilamide disaster in 1937, where over 100 people died due to the use of a toxic solvent in a medication.
- **Pharmacokinetics** — knowledge of how drugs are absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and eliminated by the body is essential for determining optimal dosing regimens, and ignoring pharmacokinetics principles resulted in the failure of the antiviral drug, sorivudine, which caused severe side effects due to its interaction with other medications.
- **Pharmacodynamics** — understanding the effects of drugs on biological systems is critical for predicting therapeutic outcomes, and the lack of pharmacodynamics knowledge led to the development of the anti-inflammatory drug, rofecoxib, which was later withdrawn from the market due to increased risk of heart attacks and strokes.
- **Clinical Trials** — rigorous testing of drugs in human subjects is necessary to establish efficacy and safety, and the absence of adequate clinical trials led to the approval of the diet drug, fen-phen, which was later linked to serious heart valve problems.
- **Regulatory Compliance** — adherence to regulatory standards and guidelines is necessary to ensure that drugs are safe and effective, and non-compliance led to the shutdown of the generic drug manufacturer, Ranbaxy, due to poor manufacturing practices and data falsification.

## Priority Order
The dependencies can be ranked in the following order:
1. **Biochemistry** - as it provides the foundation for understanding how drugs interact with biological systems.
2. **Toxicology** - since understanding the potential harm caused by drugs is crucial for ensuring safe use.
3. **Pharmacokinetics** - as it is essential for determining optimal dosing regimens and minimizing adverse effects.
4. **Pharmacodynamics** - because predicting therapeutic outcomes is critical for developing effective treatments.
5. **Clinical Trials** - as they provide the necessary evidence for establishing efficacy and safety.
6. **Regulatory Compliance** - while important, it is the last line of defense, and non-compliance can be addressed through audits and inspections.

## Common Gaps
People often overlook the importance of **Pharmacogenomics**, assuming that drugs will have the same effect on all individuals, but genetic variations can significantly impact drug response, and ignoring pharmacogenomics can lead to reduced efficacy or increased toxicity, as seen in the case of the blood thinner, warfarin, where genetic differences affect the required dosage.
