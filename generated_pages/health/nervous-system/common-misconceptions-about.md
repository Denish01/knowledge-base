# Common Misconceptions About Nervous System

The most common misconception about the nervous system is that it is a single, unified entity, when in fact it is composed of two distinct systems: the **central nervous system** (CNS) and the **peripheral nervous system** (PNS), with the CNS comprising the brain and spinal cord, and the PNS consisting of nerves that connect the CNS to the rest of the body (Kandel, 2000).

## Misconceptions
- **Myth:** The nervous system is solely responsible for controlling voluntary movements, such as walking and talking.
- **Fact:** The nervous system also controls involuntary movements, such as digestion and heart rate, with the **autonomic nervous system** regulating these functions (Berne, 2004).
- **Source of confusion:** This myth persists due to the emphasis on voluntary movement in introductory neuroscience textbooks, such as Bear's Neuroscience: Exploring the Brain.
- **Myth:** The brain and spinal cord are the only components of the nervous system.
- **Fact:** The PNS, which includes nerves such as the **vagus nerve**, plays a crucial role in transmitting and receiving information between the CNS and the rest of the body, with the vagus nerve alone containing ~100,000 fibers (Guyton, 2006).
- **Source of confusion:** The media narrative often focuses on the brain as the sole controller of the body, neglecting the importance of the PNS.
- **Myth:** Neurotransmitters are only involved in transmitting signals between neurons.
- **Fact:** Neurotransmitters, such as **dopamine** and **serotonin**, also play a role in regulating various bodily functions, including mood, appetite, and sleep, with dopamine regulating reward processing in the **nucleus accumbens** (Schultz, 2002).
- **Source of confusion:** This myth persists due to the oversimplification of neurotransmitter function in popular science literature.
- **Myth:** The nervous system is fully formed at birth.
- **Fact:** The nervous system continues to develop and mature throughout childhood and adolescence, with **synaptic pruning** occurring until the mid-20s (Huttenlocher, 1979).
- **Source of confusion:** The logical fallacy of assuming that the nervous system is fully developed at birth is perpetuated by the lack of discussion on neural development in non-technical literature.
- **Myth:** The nervous system is incapable of repairing itself.
- **Fact:** The nervous system has a limited capacity for **neuroplasticity**, with the brain able to reorganize itself in response to injury or experience, as seen in the **London taxi drivers** who develop increased **hippocampal** volume (Maguire, 2000).
- **Source of confusion:** This myth persists due to the historical view of the nervous system as a fixed, unchangeable entity.

## Quick Reference
- **Myth:** Nervous system is a single entity → **Fact:** Composed of CNS and PNS
- **Myth:** Nervous system only controls voluntary movement → **Fact:** Also controls involuntary movements
- **Myth:** Brain and spinal cord are the only components → **Fact:** PNS plays a crucial role
- **Myth:** Neurotransmitters only transmit signals → **Fact:** Regulate various bodily functions
- **Myth:** Nervous system is fully formed at birth → **Fact:** Continues to develop throughout childhood and adolescence
- **Myth:** Nervous system is incapable of repairing itself → **Fact:** Has a limited capacity for neuroplasticity
