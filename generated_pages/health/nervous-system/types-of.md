# Types of Nervous System

There are two main categories of nervous systems, which are distinguished by their structural and functional characteristics: the **Central Nervous System (CNS)** and the **Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)**, with the CNS further subdivided into the **Brain** and **Spinal Cord**, and the PNS into the **Somatic Nervous System** and **Autonomic Nervous System**.

## Main Categories
- **Central Nervous System (CNS)** — the CNS is the control center of the body, responsible for integrating and processing information from sensory inputs, controlling movement and behavior, and managing functions such as consciousness, cognition, and emotion, with the human brain being a prime example.
- **Brain** — the brain is the most complex part of the CNS, responsible for controlling all voluntary movements, managing sensory information, and facilitating thought, emotion, and memory, with the human cerebral cortex being a key component.
- **Spinal Cord** — the spinal cord is a long, thin, tube-like structure that extends from the base of the brain down to the lower back, serving as a conduit for messages between the brain and the rest of the body, with the spinal cord of the cat being a well-studied example.
- **Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)** — the PNS is a network of nerves that connect the CNS to the rest of the body, responsible for transmitting and receiving signals to and from muscles, sensory receptors, and glands, with the sciatic nerve in humans being a notable example.
- **Somatic Nervous System** — the somatic nervous system is a part of the PNS that controls voluntary movements, such as walking, talking, and writing, with the nerve impulses that control the muscles of the human hand being a specific example.
- **Autonomic Nervous System** — the autonomic nervous system is a part of the PNS that controls involuntary functions, such as heart rate, digestion, and blood pressure, with the vagus nerve in humans being a key component.

## Comparison Table
| Category | Function | Location | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CNS | Control center | Brain and spinal cord | Human brain |
| PNS | Transmit and receive signals | Nerves throughout the body | Sciatic nerve in humans |
| Somatic Nervous System | Control voluntary movements | Muscles and sensory receptors | Nerve impulses in the human hand |
| Autonomic Nervous System | Control involuntary functions | Internal organs and glands | Vagus nerve in humans |
| Brain | Control movement, sensation, and cognition | Cranium | Human cerebral cortex |
| Spinal Cord | Conduit for messages between brain and body | Spinal column | Spinal cord of the cat |

## How They Relate
The CNS and PNS are interconnected and interdependent, with the CNS serving as the control center and the PNS serving as the communication network. The **Brain** and **Spinal Cord** are both part of the CNS, while the **Somatic Nervous System** and **Autonomic Nervous System** are both part of the PNS. The **Somatic Nervous System** and **Autonomic Nervous System** can be confused with each other, as they both involve the transmission of nerve impulses, but they have distinct functions and locations. The **Brain** and **Spinal Cord** can also be confused with each other, as they are both part of the CNS, but they have different structures and functions. Specifically, the **Brain** is responsible for higher-level functions such as thought and emotion, while the **Spinal Cord** serves as a conduit for messages between the brain and the rest of the body.
