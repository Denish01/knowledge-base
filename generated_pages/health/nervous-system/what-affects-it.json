  "content": "Genetics is the single biggest factor affecting the nervous system, with genetic mutations **increasing** the risk of neurodegenerative diseases by up to 50% (National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke).\n\n## Main Factors\n- **Genetics** \u2014 genetic mutations **increase** the risk of neurodegenerative diseases by up to 50%, as seen in Huntington's disease, where a single mutation can cause a 100% chance of developing the disease (National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke).\n- **Age** \u2014 aging **decreases** the production of neurons by 10% per decade after age 20 (Harvard Health Publishing), leading to a decline in cognitive function, with a 20% decrease in reaction time by age 60 (National Institute on Aging).\n- **Nutrition** \u2014 a diet rich in **omega-3 fatty acids** **increases** the growth of neurons by 20% (University of California, Los Angeles), as seen in a study where participants who consumed 1000mg of omega-3 fatty acids daily showed improved cognitive function.\n- **Exercise** \u2014 regular physical activity **increases** the production of neurotrophic factors by 30% (University of Illinois), leading to improved cognitive function, with a 15% increase in memory recall in individuals who exercise for 30 minutes, 3 times a week (American College of Sports Medicine).\n- **Stress** \u2014 chronic stress **decreases** the production of neurotransmitters by 25% (American Psychological Association), leading to anxiety and depression, with a 40% increase in the risk of developing depression in individuals who experience chronic stress (World Health Organization).\n- **Sleep** \u2014 adequate sleep **increases** the clearance of neurotoxic waste by 20% (National Sleep Foundation), leading to improved cognitive function, with a 10% increase in alertness and attention in individuals who sleep for 7-9 hours per night (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).\n- **Toxins** \u2014 exposure to **heavy metals** **decreases** the production of neurons by 15% (Environmental Protection Agency), leading to neurodegenerative diseases, with a 30% increase in the risk of developing Parkinson's disease in individuals exposed to high levels of heavy metals (National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences).\n\n## How They Interact\nThe interaction between **Genetics** and **Nutrition** can amplify the risk of neurodegenerative diseases, as a diet low in **omega-3 fatty acids** can **increase** the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease by 20% in individuals with a genetic predisposition (Rush University Medical Center). The interaction between **Exercise** and **Stress** can cancel each other out, as regular physical activity can **decrease** the negative effects of chronic stress on cognitive function by 15% (University of California, Irvine). The interaction between **Sleep** and **Toxins** can also amplify the risk of neurodegenerative diseases, as exposure to **heavy metals** can **decrease** the quality of sleep by 10%, leading to a 25% increase in the risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases (National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences).\n\n## Controllable vs Uncontrollable\nThe controllable factors affecting the nervous system include **Nutrition**, **Exercise**, **Stress**, and **Sleep**, which can be controlled by individuals through their lifestyle choices. For example, individuals can control their **Nutrition** by consuming a diet rich in **omega-3 fatty acids**, **Exercise** by engaging in regular physical activity, **Stress** by practicing stress-reducing techniques, and **Sleep** by establishing a consistent sleep schedule. The uncontrollable factors include **Genetics**, **Age**, and **Toxins**, which are outside of an individual's control. However, individuals can still take steps to mitigate the negative effects of these factors, such as engaging in regular physical activity to reduce the risk of age-related cognitive decline, and avoiding exposure to **heavy metals** to reduce the risk of neurodegenerative diseases.",
