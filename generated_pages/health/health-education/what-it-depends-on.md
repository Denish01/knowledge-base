# What Health Education Depends On

Health education depends on **Cultural Competence** — the ability to understand and respond to the unique cultural needs of diverse populations, which is required to ensure that health education programs are effective and accessible to all individuals, as evidenced by the failure of the US Public Health Service's syphilis treatment program for African American men in the 1930s, which was marred by a lack of cultural sensitivity and resulted in the withholding of treatment from participants.

## Key Dependencies
- **Cultural Competence** — without it, health education programs may be ineffective or even harmful, as seen in the case of the US Public Health Service's syphilis treatment program, where a lack of cultural sensitivity led to the withholding of treatment from African American men.
- **Health Literacy** — the ability to read, understand, and act on health information is crucial for individuals to make informed decisions about their health, and its absence can lead to poor health outcomes, such as the high rates of medication non-adherence among patients with low health literacy, as seen in a study of patients with diabetes.
- **Community Engagement** — the involvement of local communities in the development and implementation of health education programs is necessary to ensure that programs are relevant and effective, as demonstrated by the success of the **Partners in Health** program in Rwanda, which engaged local communities in the development of health education programs and resulted in significant improvements in health outcomes.
- **Evidence-Based Practice** — the use of scientific evidence to inform health education programs is essential to ensure that programs are effective and safe, and its absence can lead to the dissemination of inaccurate or misleading information, as seen in the case of the anti-vaccination movement, which has been linked to outbreaks of preventable diseases.
- **Technological Infrastructure** — the availability of technology, such as computers and internet access, is necessary to support the development and delivery of health education programs, and its absence can limit the reach and effectiveness of programs, as seen in the case of rural areas with limited access to technology, where health education programs may be less effective due to a lack of resources.
- **Funding** — the availability of financial resources is necessary to support the development and implementation of health education programs, and its absence can limit the scope and effectiveness of programs, as seen in the case of the **Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria**, which has faced funding shortfalls that have limited its ability to support health education programs in developing countries.

## Priority Order
The dependencies can be ranked in order of priority as follows:
- **Cultural Competence**: this is the most critical dependency, as it is essential to ensure that health education programs are effective and accessible to all individuals, regardless of their cultural background.
- **Health Literacy**: this is the second most critical dependency, as it is necessary to ensure that individuals can understand and act on health information.
- **Community Engagement**: this is the third most critical dependency, as it is necessary to ensure that health education programs are relevant and effective.
- **Evidence-Based Practice**: this is the fourth most critical dependency, as it is essential to ensure that health education programs are effective and safe.
- **Technological Infrastructure**: this is the fifth most critical dependency, as it is necessary to support the development and delivery of health education programs.
- **Funding**: this is the sixth most critical dependency, as it is necessary to support the development and implementation of health education programs, but it is not as critical as the other dependencies, as programs can be adapted to be low-cost or no-cost.

## Common Gaps
One common assumption that people overlook is that **health education programs can be developed and implemented without considering the local context**, which can lead to programs that are ineffective or even harmful, as seen in the case of the US Public Health Service's syphilis treatment program. Another common gap is the assumption that **health education programs can be effective without community engagement**, which can lead to programs that are not relevant or effective, as seen in the case of top-down health education programs that have been imposed on local communities without their input.
