  "content": "There are seven main categories of health education, organized around the target audience, delivery method, and content focus. \n## Main Categories\n- **Patient Education** \u2014 focuses on informing patients about their specific health conditions, treatments, and self-care strategies, as seen in the work of the **American Diabetes Association**, which provides personalized guidance to patients with diabetes.\n- **School Health Education** \u2014 teaches students about healthy habits, disease prevention, and wellness, exemplified by the **Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC)** Health Education Curriculum Analysis Tool.\n- **Community Health Education** \u2014 targets community-wide health issues, such as nutrition, physical activity, and disease prevention, as demonstrated by the **World Health Organization's (WHO)** efforts to promote healthy lifestyles globally.\n- **Worksite Health Education** \u2014 provides health promotion and disease prevention programs for employees, as seen in the **Wellness Council of America's** workplace wellness initiatives.\n- **Clinical Health Education** \u2014 involves healthcare professionals educating patients about their health conditions and treatments, as practiced by the **American Heart Association**, which provides clinical guidance on heart health.\n- **Public Health Education** \u2014 focuses on preventing disease and promoting health at the population level, as exemplified by the **CDC's** public health campaigns on infectious disease prevention.\n- **Health Literacy Education** \u2014 aims to improve individuals' ability to understand and navigate the healthcare system, as promoted by the **National Institutes of Health's (NIH)** health literacy initiatives.\n\n## Comparison Table\n| Category | Target Audience | Delivery Method | Cost |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Patient Education | Patients | One-on-one counseling, printed materials | Moderate (~$100 per patient, American Medical Association) |\n| School Health Education | Students | Classroom instruction, curriculum integration | Low (~$10 per student, CDC) |\n| Community Health Education | Community members | Public events, social media campaigns | High (~$10,000 per campaign, WHO) |\n| Worksite Health Education | Employees | Workplace wellness programs, health fairs | Moderate (~$500 per employee, Wellness Council of America) |\n| Clinical Health Education | Patients | Healthcare provider counseling, patient education materials | Low (~$50 per patient, American Heart Association) |\n| Public Health Education | General public | Mass media campaigns, public events | High (~$100,000 per campaign, CDC) |\n| Health Literacy Education | Individuals with limited health literacy | One-on-one counseling, educational materials | Moderate (~$200 per individual, NIH) |\n\n## How They Relate\nCategories often overlap, such as **Patient Education** and **Clinical Health Education**, which both involve healthcare professionals educating patients about their health conditions. **School Health Education** and **Community Health Education** may also intersect, as schools can serve as a platform for community-wide health initiatives. Additionally, **Public Health Education** and **Health Literacy Education** are closely related, as improving health literacy is a key component of public health education efforts. For instance, the **CDC's** public health campaigns on infectious disease prevention often incorporate health literacy principles to ensure that messages are accessible to a wide audience. Furthermore, **Worksite Health Education** and **Patient Education** may overlap, as employees with chronic health conditions may require personalized guidance on managing their conditions in the workplace.",
