The process begins with the recognition of **antigens**, which are molecules on the surface of pathogens that trigger an immune response. This recognition is mediated by **pattern recognition receptors**, such as **Toll-like receptors**, which activate signaling pathways that lead to the production of **cytokines** and the activation of immune cells. For example, the **Toll-like receptor 4** recognizes the **lipopolysaccharide** molecule on the surface of Gram-negative bacteria, leading to the activation of **NF-\u03baB** and the production of **pro-inflammatory cytokines**.\n\nThe activation of immune cells leads to the production of **antibodies**, which are proteins that recognize and bind to specific antigens. Antibodies can neutralize pathogens by blocking their entry into host cells or by marking them for destruction by immune cells. The production of antibodies is mediated by **B cells**, which undergo **class switching** to produce different types of antibodies, such as **IgG** and **IgE**. The **class switching** process is regulated by **activation-induced cytidine deaminase**, an enzyme that introduces mutations into the **immunoglobulin** gene.\n\nThe immune system also has a **memory** component, which allows it to remember specific pathogens and mount a more rapid and effective response upon subsequent infections. This is mediated by **memory T cells** and **memory B cells**, which are long-lived cells that can recognize and respond to specific antigens. The **memory** component of the immune system is critical for **vaccine-induced immunity**, which relies on the generation of **memory T cells** and **memory B cells** to provide long-term protection against specific pathogens.\n\n## Key Components\n- **Innate immunity**: provides immediate defense against pathogens, mediated by cells such as **neutrophils** and **macrophages**, which produce **reactive oxygen species** and **lysosomal enzymes** to kill pathogens.\n- **Adaptive immunity**: provides specific defense against pathogens, mediated by **T cells** and **B cells**, which recognize and respond to specific antigens.\n- **Antibodies**: proteins that recognize and bind to specific antigens, neutralizing pathogens or marking them for destruction by immune cells.\n- **Cytokines**: signaling molecules that mediate the activation and regulation of immune cells, such as **TNF-\u03b1** and **IL-1\u03b2**, which promote inflammation and immune cell activation.\n- **Immune tolerance**: the ability of the immune system to recognize and tolerate self-antigens, preventing autoimmune disease, which is mediated by **regulatory T cells** and **tolerogenic dendritic cells**.\n- **Mucosal immunity**: the immune response at mucosal surfaces, such as the gut and respiratory tract, which is mediated by **IgA** antibodies and **mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue**.\n\n## Common Misconceptions\n**Myth:** The immune system is fully developed at birth \u2014 **Fact:** The immune system continues to develop and mature throughout childhood and adolescence, with **thymic function** declining with age (Weinberg et al.).\n**Myth:** Vaccines are 100% effective \u2014 **Fact:** Vaccines are highly effective, but not 100%, with **influenza vaccine** effectiveness ranging from 40% to 60% (CDC).\n**Myth:** Antibiotics are effective against all infections \u2014 **Fact:** Antibiotics are only effective against bacterial infections, and **antibiotic resistance** is a growing concern, with **MRSA** and **ESBL** being examples of resistant bacteria (WHO).\n\n## In Practice\nThe **Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)** is a prime example of the importance of immunology in practice. HIV infects and destroys **CD4+ T cells**, leading to a weakened immune system and increased susceptibility to opportunistic infections. The **HIV vaccine** is still in development, but **antiretroviral therapy** has been successful in managing the disease, with **combination therapy** using **AZT**, **3TC**, and **EFV** being a common treatment regimen. The **Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria** has provided ~$40 billion in funding for HIV treatment and prevention programs since its inception (Global Fund).",
