# What Immunology Depends On

Immunology depends on **genetics**, as the human immune system's ability to recognize and respond to pathogens is influenced by an individual's genetic makeup, and a deficiency in certain genes can lead to impaired immune function, such as the case of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), where a mutation in the ADA gene results in a non-functional immune system.

## Key Dependencies
- **Genetics** — a lack of genetic diversity can lead to decreased immune function, as seen in the case of the Irish population, where a limited gene pool has resulted in a higher incidence of certain immune disorders (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).
- **Nutrition** — inadequate nutrition can impair immune function, as a lack of essential vitamins and minerals, such as vitamin D, can lead to decreased immune cell function, as seen in the case of rickets, where a deficiency in vitamin D results in impaired immune function (World Health Organization).
- **Microbiome** — an imbalance of the gut microbiome can lead to impaired immune function, as seen in the case of antibiotic use, where the disruption of the gut microbiome can lead to decreased immune function and increased susceptibility to infection (National Institutes of Health).
- **Environmental factors** — exposure to environmental toxins, such as pesticides and heavy metals, can impair immune function, as seen in the case of pesticide exposure, where a study found that exposure to certain pesticides resulted in decreased immune function in farm workers (Environmental Protection Agency).
- **Hormonal balance** — an imbalance of hormones, such as cortisol and insulin, can impair immune function, as seen in the case of Cushing's syndrome, where an excess of cortisol results in impaired immune function (National Institutes of Health).
- **Age** — advancing age can lead to decreased immune function, as seen in the case of elderly individuals, where a decline in immune function results in increased susceptibility to infection (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).

## Priority Order
The dependencies can be ranked in order of priority as follows:
- **Genetics**, as a deficiency in certain genes can result in severe immune disorders, such as SCID.
- **Nutrition**, as inadequate nutrition can impair immune function and increase susceptibility to infection.
- **Microbiome**, as an imbalance of the gut microbiome can lead to impaired immune function and increased susceptibility to infection.
- **Hormonal balance**, as an imbalance of hormones can impair immune function and increase susceptibility to infection.
- **Environmental factors**, as exposure to environmental toxins can impair immune function and increase susceptibility to infection.
- **Age**, as advancing age can lead to decreased immune function, but this is a natural process that cannot be prevented.

## Common Gaps
One common assumption that people overlook is that a healthy lifestyle is enough to maintain immune function, without considering the impact of **genetic predisposition** on immune function, which can lead to a failure to recognize and address underlying genetic disorders, such as SCID, resulting in impaired immune function and increased susceptibility to infection.
