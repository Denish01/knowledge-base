  "content": "The **immune system** is a complex mechanism that protects the body against **pathogens**, such as bacteria, viruses, and other foreign substances, through a cause-and-effect chain involving **immune cells**, **inflammation**, and **antibody production**.\n\n## The Mechanism\nThe immune system's core mechanism involves the recognition of **antigens** by **immune cells**, such as **T-cells** and **B-cells**, which triggers a series of responses to eliminate the invading pathogens. This process involves the activation of **immune cells**, the production of **cytokines** and **antibodies**, and the recruitment of **immune cells** to the site of infection.\n\n## Step-by-Step\n1. **Pathogen recognition**: The immune system recognizes **pathogens** through **pattern recognition receptors** (PRRs) on **immune cells**, such as **dendritic cells**, which detect **pathogen-associated molecular patterns** (PAMPs) and trigger an immune response, resulting in the activation of **100-1000** **immune cells** per site of infection.\n2. **Immune cell activation**: Activated **dendritic cells** migrate to **lymph nodes**, where they interact with **T-cells**, activating **50-70%** of **naive T-cells** to become **effector T-cells**, which produce **cytokines**, such as **interferon-gamma** (IFN-\u03b3), at a concentration of **10-100 ng/mL**.\n3. **Cytokine production**: **Effector T-cells** produce **cytokines**, which recruit **immune cells**, such as **neutrophils** and **macrophages**, to the site of infection, resulting in the elimination of **90-99%** of **pathogens** within **24-48 hours**.\n4. **Antibody production**: Activated **B-cells** produce **antibodies**, such as **IgG** and **IgM**, which bind to **pathogens**, marking them for destruction, with **IgG** levels increasing by **10-100-fold** within **7-14 days** after infection.\n5. **Immune cell recruitment**: **Cytokines** and **chemokines** recruit **immune cells** to the site of infection, resulting in the accumulation of **1000-10000** **immune cells** per site of infection, which eliminates **pathogens** and promotes tissue repair.\n6. **Tissue repair**: The immune system promotes tissue repair by producing **growth factors**, such as **platelet-derived growth factor** (PDGF), which stimulates the proliferation of **fibroblasts** and **endothelial cells**, resulting in the restoration of **80-90%** of tissue function within **7-14 days**.\n\n## Key Components\n- **Immune cells**: **T-cells**, **B-cells**, **dendritic cells**, **neutrophils**, and **macrophages** work together to recognize and eliminate **pathogens**.\n- **Cytokines**: **Interferon-gamma** (IFN-\u03b3), **tumor necrosis factor-alpha** (TNF-\u03b1), and **interleukin-1 beta** (IL-1\u03b2) coordinate the immune response, with **IFN-\u03b3** inducing the production of **inducible nitric oxide synthase** (iNOS) in **macrophages**.\n- **Antibodies**: **IgG** and **IgM** bind to **pathogens**, marking them for destruction, with **IgG** being the most abundant antibody in human serum, accounting for **75-80%** of total antibody production.\n- **Lymph nodes**: **Lymph nodes** serve as sites for **immune cell** activation, proliferation, and differentiation, with **lymph nodes** containing **1000-10000** **immune cells** per gram of tissue.\n\n## Common Questions\nWhat happens if the **thymus** is damaged? The **thymus** is responsible for the development and maturation of **T-cells**, and damage to the **thymus** can lead to **immunodeficiency**, resulting in an increased susceptibility to **infections**, such as **pneumocystis pneumonia**, which affects **50-70%** of individuals with **thymic aplasia**.\nWhat is the role of **dendritic cells** in the immune response? **Dendritic cells** recognize **pathogens** and activate **T-cells**, which triggers an immune response, with **dendritic cells** producing **10-100** **major histocompatibility complex** (MHC) molecules per cell.\nCan the immune system be strengthened? Yes, the immune system can be strengthened through **vaccination**, which exposes the immune system to **antigens** and stimulates the production of **antibodies** and **immune cells**, resulting in an increase in **antibody titers** by **10-100-fold** within **7-14 days** after vaccination.\nWhat happens if **B-cells** are defective? Defective **B-cells** can lead to **humoral immunodeficiency**, resulting in an increased susceptibility to **infections**, such as **streptococcal pneumonia**, which affects **20-50%** of individuals with **X-linked agammaglobulinemia**.",
