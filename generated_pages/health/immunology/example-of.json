  "content": "## Definition\nImmunology is the study of the immune system, its functions, and its responses to infectious organisms and other foreign substances, founded on the principles of **vaccination** developed by Edward Jenner in 1796.\n\n## How It Works\nThe immune system is composed of multiple cell types, including **T cells** and **B cells**, which work together to recognize and eliminate pathogens. The process begins with the recognition of **antigens**, foreign substances that trigger an immune response, by **dendritic cells**, which then activate **T cells** through the presentation of **major histocompatibility complex (MHC)** molecules. This activation leads to the proliferation of **T cells** and the production of **cytokines**, signaling molecules that coordinate the immune response. According to the **clonal selection theory**, proposed by Frank Macfarlane Burnet in 1957, the immune system selects and expands specific **B cell** and **T cell** clones that recognize and respond to particular **antigens**.\n\nThe immune response can be divided into two main branches: **innate immunity**, which provides immediate defense against infection, and **adaptive immunity**, which is specific to individual pathogens and takes longer to develop. **Innate immunity** is mediated by cells such as **neutrophils** and **macrophages**, which recognize and engulf pathogens, while **adaptive immunity** is mediated by **T cells** and **B cells**, which recognize and respond to specific **antigens**. The **human leukocyte antigen (HLA)** system, which is responsible for the presentation of **antigens** to **T cells**, is a critical component of the immune response, with over 12,000 known **HLA** alleles (National Center for Biotechnology Information).\n\nThe **hygiene hypothesis**, proposed by David Strachan in 1989, suggests that a lack of exposure to certain microorganisms in childhood may lead to an increased risk of developing **allergic diseases**, such as **asthma** and **atopic dermatitis**. This hypothesis is supported by studies showing that children growing up in rural areas, with greater exposure to microorganisms, have a lower risk of developing **allergic diseases** (von Hertzen and Haahtela, 2006). The **gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT)**, which contains over 70% of the body's immune cells, plays a critical role in the development of the immune system and the maintenance of **immune homeostasis**.\n\n## Key Components\n- **Antibodies**: proteins produced by **B cells** that recognize and bind to specific **antigens**, helping to neutralize or remove them from the body.\n- **Cytokines**: signaling molecules that coordinate the immune response, with over 100 known **cytokines** involved in the regulation of **inflammation** and **immune cell** activation (Lodish et al., 2000).\n- **Dendritic cells**: cells that recognize and process **antigens**, presenting them to **T cells** to activate the immune response.\n- **Major histocompatibility complex (MHC)**: a group of genes that encode proteins responsible for the presentation of **antigens** to **T cells**, with over 12,000 known **MHC** alleles (National Center for Biotechnology Information).\n- **T cell receptor**: a protein complex on the surface of **T cells** that recognizes and binds to specific **antigens**, activating the **T cell** response.\n- **Toll-like receptors**: a family of receptors that recognize **pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)**, activating the **innate immune response**.\n\n## Common Misconceptions\n**Myth:** The immune system is fully developed at birth \u2014 **Fact:** The immune system continues to develop and mature throughout childhood and adolescence, with the **gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT)** playing a critical role in the development of **immune homeostasis** (West, 2014).\n**Myth:** All **vaccines** are 100% effective \u2014 **Fact:** While **vaccines** are highly effective, no **vaccine** is 100% effective, with the **influenza vaccine**, for example, having an effectiveness of around 60% (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).\n**Myth:** **Antibiotics** are effective against all types of infections \u2014 **Fact:** **Antibiotics** are only effective against bacterial infections, and their overuse has contributed to the development of **antibiotic-resistant** bacteria, such as **methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)** (World Health Organization).\n**Myth:** The immune system is only responsible for fighting infections \u2014 **Fact:** The immune system also plays a critical role in the development of **cancer**, with the **immune system** able to recognize and eliminate **cancer cells** through the activation of **immune checkpoints**, such as **PD-1** and **CTLA-4** (Sharma and Allison, 2015).\n\n## In Practice\nThe development of **vaccines** against infectious diseases, such as **influenza** and **human papillomavirus (HPV)**, has had a significant impact on public health, with the **influenza vaccine** alone preventing an estimated 40,000 to 80,000 hospitalizations annually in the United States (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). The use of **immunotherapy**, such as **checkpoint inhibitors**, has also revolutionized the treatment of **cancer**, with **pembrolizumab**, for example, improving overall survival in patients with **non-small cell lung cancer** by 50% (Reck et al., 2016).",
