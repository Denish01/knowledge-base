# Types of Quarantine

There are five main categories of quarantine, organized by their purpose and scope: **Home Quarantine**, **Institutional Quarantine**, **Travel Quarantine**, **Community Quarantine**, and **Military Quarantine**.

## Main Categories
- **Home Quarantine** — a type of quarantine where individuals are isolated in their homes to prevent the spread of disease, characterized by limited movement and social interaction, as seen in the case of the **SARS outbreak in Toronto**, where thousands of people were asked to stay at home to prevent the spread of the disease.
- **Institutional Quarantine** — a type of quarantine where individuals are isolated in a specific institution, such as a hospital or detention center, characterized by strict controls on movement and interaction, as seen in the case of the **Ebola outbreak in West Africa**, where patients were isolated in specialized treatment centers.
- **Travel Quarantine** — a type of quarantine where travelers are isolated upon arrival in a new location, characterized by restrictions on movement and interaction with the local population, as seen in the case of the **COVID-19 pandemic**, where many countries imposed travel restrictions and quarantines on incoming travelers.
- **Community Quarantine** — a type of quarantine where an entire community is isolated to prevent the spread of disease, characterized by restrictions on movement and interaction with the outside world, as seen in the case of the **lockdown in Wuhan, China**, where the entire city was placed under quarantine to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
- **Military Quarantine** — a type of quarantine where military personnel are isolated to prevent the spread of disease, characterized by strict controls on movement and interaction, as seen in the case of the **US military's quarantine protocols during the Spanish flu pandemic**, where soldiers were isolated in barracks to prevent the spread of the disease.

## Comparison Table
| Category | Cost | Scale | Speed | Risk |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Home Quarantine** | Low | Individual | Fast | Low |
| **Institutional Quarantine** | Medium | Small group | Medium | Medium |
| **Travel Quarantine** | High | Large group | Fast | High |
| **Community Quarantine** | Very High | Entire community | Slow | Very High |
| **Military Quarantine** | Medium | Small group | Fast | Medium |

## How They Relate
The categories of quarantine often overlap or feed into each other, with **Home Quarantine** and **Institutional Quarantine** being commonly confused due to their similarities in scope and purpose. **Travel Quarantine** and **Community Quarantine** are also related, as travel restrictions are often imposed to prevent the spread of disease to a new community. **Military Quarantine** is distinct from the other categories due to its specific context and protocols, but can be related to **Institutional Quarantine** in terms of the strict controls on movement and interaction. For example, the **US military's quarantine protocols during the Spanish flu pandemic** involved isolating soldiers in barracks, which is similar to the **Institutional Quarantine** used in hospitals and detention centers. Additionally, the **lockdown in Wuhan, China** during the COVID-19 pandemic involved a combination of **Community Quarantine** and **Travel Quarantine**, with the entire city being isolated and travel restrictions being imposed on incoming and outgoing travelers.
