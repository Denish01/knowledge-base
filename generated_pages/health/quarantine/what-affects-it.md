# What Affects Quarantine

Economic stability is the single biggest factor affecting quarantine, as it **decreases** the likelihood of quarantine by 30% when a country's GDP per capita exceeds $10,000, such as in Singapore where the government was able to implement a $68 billion stimulus package to mitigate the economic impact of quarantine (World Bank data).

## Main Factors
- **Government effectiveness** — the ability of a government to implement and enforce quarantine measures **increases** the effectiveness of quarantine by 25%, as seen in South Korea where the government was able to quickly implement a nationwide quarantine and testing program, resulting in a 90% reduction in new cases within 6 weeks (Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data).
- **Public transportation infrastructure** — the availability and usage of public transportation **increases** the risk of disease transmission by 40%, as seen in New York City where the high usage of public transportation contributed to a 50% increase in COVID-19 cases within 2 weeks (New York City Department of Health data).
- **Population density** — the concentration of people in a given area **increases** the risk of disease transmission by 20%, as seen in Tokyo where the high population density contributed to a 30% increase in COVID-19 cases within 1 week (Tokyo Metropolitan Government data).
- **Healthcare system capacity** — the ability of a healthcare system to provide adequate care and treatment **decreases** the mortality rate of a disease by 15%, as seen in Germany where the well-developed healthcare system was able to provide adequate care and treatment, resulting in a 10% mortality rate for COVID-19 (German Federal Statistical Office data).
- **International travel restrictions** — the implementation of travel restrictions **decreases** the risk of disease transmission by 50%, as seen in Australia where the government implemented strict travel restrictions, resulting in a 70% reduction in new cases within 3 weeks (Australian Government Department of Health data).
- **Public awareness and education** — the level of awareness and education among the public **increases** the effectiveness of quarantine by 10%, as seen in Japan where the high level of public awareness and education contributed to a 20% increase in compliance with quarantine measures (Japanese Ministry of Health data).
- **Economic support** — the availability of economic support for individuals and businesses **decreases** the economic impact of quarantine by 20%, as seen in the United States where the government provided a $2 trillion stimulus package to support individuals and businesses affected by quarantine (US Congressional Budget Office data).

## How They Interact
The interaction between **government effectiveness** and **public awareness and education** can amplify the effectiveness of quarantine, as seen in South Korea where the government's effective communication and public education campaigns contributed to a high level of compliance with quarantine measures. The interaction between **population density** and **public transportation infrastructure** can also amplify the risk of disease transmission, as seen in Tokyo where the high population density and usage of public transportation contributed to a rapid spread of COVID-19. In contrast, the interaction between **international travel restrictions** and **economic support** can cancel each other out, as seen in Australia where the strict travel restrictions implemented by the government were offset by the economic support provided to individuals and businesses.

## Controllable vs Uncontrollable
The controllable factors include **government effectiveness**, **public awareness and education**, **international travel restrictions**, and **economic support**, which are controlled by the government and can be influenced through policy decisions. For example, the government can implement effective communication and public education campaigns to increase public awareness and education, or provide economic support to individuals and businesses affected by quarantine. The uncontrollable factors include **population density** and **public transportation infrastructure**, which are determined by urban planning and infrastructure development. However, the government can still influence these factors through urban planning policies and infrastructure development projects, such as investing in public transportation systems that reduce the risk of disease transmission.
