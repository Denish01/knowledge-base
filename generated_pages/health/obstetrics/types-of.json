  "content": "There are four main categories of obstetrics, organized by the level of medical intervention and the complexity of the pregnancy: **Low-Risk Obstetrics**, **High-Risk Obstetrics**, **Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility**, and **Maternal-Fetal Medicine**. \n\n## Main Categories\n- **Low-Risk Obstetrics** \u2014 focuses on routine prenatal care, vaginal delivery, and postpartum care for healthy women with uncomplicated pregnancies, as seen in the practice of **Kaiser Permanente**, which provides comprehensive low-risk obstetric care to its members.\n- **High-Risk Obstetrics** \u2014 involves specialized care for women with pre-existing medical conditions, such as diabetes or hypertension, or those experiencing pregnancy complications, like **Cedars-Sinai Medical Center**, which has a dedicated high-risk obstetrics unit.\n- **Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility** \u2014 deals with the diagnosis and treatment of infertility, recurrent pregnancy loss, and other reproductive disorders, as exemplified by **Boston IVF**, a leading fertility clinic.\n- **Maternal-Fetal Medicine** \u2014 concentrates on the care of high-risk pregnancies, including those with fetal anomalies or maternal medical conditions, such as **University of California, San Francisco's** maternal-fetal medicine program.\n\n## Comparison Table\n| Category | Level of Medical Intervention | Cost | Risk |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Low-Risk Obstetrics** | Routine | Lower (~$10,000 for a vaginal delivery, **Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality**) | Lower |\n| **High-Risk Obstetrics** | Specialized | Higher (~$20,000 for a cesarean section, **Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services**) | Higher |\n| **Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility** | Advanced | Higher (~$15,000 per IVF cycle, **Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology**) | Variable |\n| **Maternal-Fetal Medicine** | Highly specialized | Highest (~$30,000 for a complex pregnancy, **American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists**) | Highest |\n\n## How They Relate\nThe categories of obstetrics often overlap, with **Low-Risk Obstetrics** cases sometimes requiring **High-Risk Obstetrics** care if complications arise, such as **preeclampsia**. **Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility** may feed into **Low-Risk Obstetrics** if fertility treatments are successful, as seen in the case of **in vitro fertilization (IVF)**. **Maternal-Fetal Medicine** and **High-Risk Obstetrics** are commonly confused, but **Maternal-Fetal Medicine** typically involves more complex and high-risk cases, such as **fetal surgery**. Specific pairs, like **Low-Risk Obstetrics** and **Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility**, may intersect in the care of women with **polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)**, who may require fertility treatment before receiving low-risk obstetric care.",
