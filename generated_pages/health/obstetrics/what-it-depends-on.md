# What Obstetrics Depends On

Proper **prenatal care** is the most critical dependency in obstetrics, as its absence can lead to increased risk of maternal and fetal complications, as seen in the case of the 2010 Haiti earthquake, where lack of prenatal care resulted in a significant increase in maternal mortality rates.

## Key Dependencies
- **Trained medical staff** — skilled healthcare professionals are necessary to provide adequate care during pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum. Without them, patients may not receive proper treatment, as evidenced by the 2017 Nigerian maternal mortality crisis, where a shortage of trained midwives contributed to high maternal death rates.
- **Access to medical facilities** — having a well-equipped hospital or clinic is crucial for providing a safe environment for childbirth and addressing potential complications. The absence of such facilities can lead to poor health outcomes, as seen in the 2015 South Sudan conflict, where destruction of medical infrastructure resulted in increased maternal and infant mortality.
- **Nutrition and health education** — providing patients with information on proper nutrition and health practices is essential for promoting healthy pregnancies and preventing complications. Without this, patients may not understand the importance of proper diet and care, as seen in the case of the 2011 Somali famine, where malnutrition exacerbated maternal and fetal health problems.
- **Screening and diagnostic tools** — having access to equipment such as ultrasound machines and blood tests is necessary for monitoring fetal health and detecting potential issues. The lack of these tools can lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment, as evidenced by the 2013 Philippine typhoon, where destruction of medical equipment hindered healthcare providers' ability to monitor fetal health.
- **Emergency services** — having a system in place for emergency situations, such as cesarean sections or blood transfusions, is critical for addressing life-threatening complications. Without this, patients may not receive timely treatment, as seen in the 2005 Pakistan earthquake, where lack of emergency services contributed to high maternal mortality rates.

## Priority Order
The dependencies can be ranked in order of priority as follows:
- **Trained medical staff**, as they are essential for providing adequate care and addressing complications
- **Access to medical facilities**, as a well-equipped hospital or clinic is necessary for providing a safe environment for childbirth
- **Emergency services**, as timely treatment is critical in life-threatening situations
- **Screening and diagnostic tools**, as they are necessary for monitoring fetal health and detecting potential issues
- **Nutrition and health education**, as while important, it is less critical in emergency situations

## Common Gaps
One common assumption is that **cultural sensitivity** is not essential in obstetric care, which can lead to misunderstandings and mistrust between healthcare providers and patients, resulting in poor health outcomes. For example, in some cultures, certain medical practices may be viewed as taboo, and failing to account for these cultural differences can lead to decreased patient compliance and increased risk of complications.
