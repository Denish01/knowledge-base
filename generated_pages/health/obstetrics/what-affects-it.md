# What Affects Obstetrics

Prenatal care access **decreases** the risk of maternal mortality by 30% and infant mortality by 25%, as seen in the example of the **Nurses-Family Partnership** program, which has been implemented in numerous countries and has shown a significant reduction in preterm births, with a 35% reduction in the United States (Nurses-Family Partnership annual report).

## Main Factors
- **Socioeconomic status** — influences obstetrics by limiting access to healthcare services, **decreasing** the likelihood of receiving adequate prenatal care, and **increasing** the risk of maternal and infant mortality, as seen in the example of a study in Brazil, where women from lower socioeconomic backgrounds had a 40% higher risk of maternal mortality (World Health Organization).
- **Nutrition and diet** — affects obstetrics by **increasing** the risk of gestational diabetes and hypertension in women with poor diets, with a 20% increase in gestational diabetes risk for women consuming high-sugar diets (American Diabetes Association), and **decreasing** the risk of birth defects in women with adequate folic acid intake, with a 70% reduction in neural tube defects (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).
- **Access to healthcare** — impacts obstetrics by **decreasing** the risk of maternal and infant mortality, with a 75% reduction in maternal mortality in countries with universal healthcare access (World Health Organization), and **increasing** the likelihood of receiving adequate prenatal care, as seen in the example of the **Community Health Worker** program in India, which has shown a significant increase in prenatal care utilization, with an 85% increase in institutional deliveries.
- **Genetics** — influences obstetrics by **increasing** the risk of certain birth defects and genetic disorders, such as sickle cell anemia, which affects 1 in 500 births in the United States (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), and **decreasing** the risk of others, as seen in the example of women from populations with high frequencies of the sickle cell trait, who have a 50% lower risk of malaria (National Institutes of Health).
- **Environmental factors** — affects obstetrics by **increasing** the risk of preterm birth and low birth weight in women exposed to air pollution, with a 10% increase in preterm births for every 10 μg/m3 increase in particulate matter (Environmental Protection Agency), and **decreasing** the risk of birth defects in women with access to clean water and sanitation, as seen in the example of a study in Ghana, where women with access to improved sanitation had a 30% lower risk of birth defects (World Health Organization).
- **Age and parity** — influences obstetrics by **increasing** the risk of maternal and infant mortality in women over 35 years old, with a 30% increase in maternal mortality risk for every 5-year increase in age (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists), and **decreasing** the risk of certain birth defects in women with higher parity, as seen in the example of a study in the United Kingdom, where women with higher parity had a 20% lower risk of preterm birth (National Health Service).
- **Pre-existing medical conditions** — affects obstetrics by **increasing** the risk of maternal and infant mortality in women with pre-existing conditions, such as hypertension and diabetes, with a 50% increase in maternal mortality risk for women with pre-existing hypertension (American Heart Association), and **decreasing** the risk of certain birth defects in women with well-managed conditions, as seen in the example of a study in the United States, where women with well-managed diabetes had a 40% lower risk of birth defects (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).

## How They Interact
The interaction between **socioeconomic status** and **access to healthcare** can amplify the risk of maternal and infant mortality, as seen in the example of a study in South Africa, where women from lower socioeconomic backgrounds had a 60% higher risk of maternal mortality due to limited access to healthcare services (World Health Organization). The interaction between **nutrition and diet** and **genetics** can also amplify the risk of certain birth defects, as seen in the example of a study in the United States, where women with a family history of neural tube defects had a 30% higher risk of having a child with a neural tube defect if they had inadequate folic acid intake (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). The interaction between **environmental factors** and **age and parity** can cancel each other out, as seen in the example of a study in China, where older women with higher parity had a lower risk of preterm birth due to their increased experience with pregnancy and childbirth, despite being exposed to higher levels of air pollution (National Bureau of Statistics of China).

## Controllable vs Uncontrollable
The controllable factors, such as **access to healthcare**, **nutrition and diet**, and **environmental factors**, can be controlled by **healthcare providers**, **individuals**, and **governments**, respectively, through the implementation of policies and programs that improve access to healthcare services, promote healthy diets, and reduce exposure to environmental pollutants. The uncontrollable factors, such as **genetics** and **age and parity**, cannot be controlled by individuals or healthcare providers, but can be mitigated through the use of genetic counseling and prenatal care. **Socioeconomic status** can be influenced by **governments** and **individuals** through the implementation of policies and programs that reduce poverty and improve access to education and employment opportunities.
