# What Is Hypertension?

## Definition
Hypertension is a medical condition characterized by elevated blood pressure, defined as a systolic pressure of 130 mmHg or higher and a diastolic pressure of 80 mmHg or higher, as stated by the American Heart Association.

## How It Works
Hypertension occurs when the force of blood against the walls of arteries is too high, causing damage to the blood vessels and increasing the risk of heart disease, stroke, and kidney disease. The **renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system** (RAAS) plays a significant role in regulating blood pressure, with the hormone angiotensin II causing blood vessels to constrict and increase blood pressure. According to the **Guyton's model** of blood pressure regulation, the RAAS system is activated when blood volume decreases, leading to an increase in blood pressure to maintain adequate blood flow to vital organs.

The **sympathetic nervous system** also contributes to the development of hypertension by increasing heart rate and blood vessel constriction, which increases blood pressure. For example, the **baroreceptor reflex**, a negative feedback mechanism that helps regulate blood pressure, can be impaired in individuals with hypertension, leading to increased sympathetic nervous system activity and further elevations in blood pressure. The **blood vessel wall** itself can also become damaged and stiffened, leading to increased blood pressure, with the **endothelium**, a thin layer of cells lining the blood vessels, playing a critical role in regulating blood vessel tone and blood pressure.

The **kidneys** also play a crucial role in regulating blood pressure by controlling the amount of fluid in the bloodstream and adjusting the amount of sodium and water reabsorbed into the bloodstream. The **juxtaglomerular apparatus**, a specialized structure in the kidneys, helps regulate blood pressure by controlling the release of renin, an enzyme that activates the RAAS system. With approximately 1 in 3 adults in the United States having hypertension (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), the economic burden of hypertension is substantial, with estimated annual costs of over $50 billion (American Heart Association).

## Key Components
- **Systolic blood pressure**: the top number in a blood pressure reading, measuring the pressure in the arteries when the heart beats, with elevated levels increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease. An increase in systolic blood pressure can lead to increased cardiac workload and potential damage to the heart.
- **Diastolic blood pressure**: the bottom number in a blood pressure reading, measuring the pressure in the arteries between beats, with low levels potentially indicating decreased blood flow to vital organs. A decrease in diastolic blood pressure can lead to decreased perfusion of vital organs, such as the brain and kidneys.
- **Blood vessel compliance**: the ability of blood vessels to stretch and expand in response to increased blood pressure, with decreased compliance leading to increased blood pressure. The **elastin** and **collagen** content of blood vessels can affect their compliance, with elastin providing elasticity and collagen providing strength.
- **Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system**: a hormone system that regulates blood pressure by controlling fluid balance and blood vessel constriction. The **aldosterone** hormone, for example, promotes sodium retention in the kidneys, leading to increased blood volume and blood pressure.
- **Sympathetic nervous system activity**: the "fight or flight" response that increases heart rate and blood vessel constriction, contributing to elevated blood pressure. The **norepinephrine** neurotransmitter, for example, stimulates the heart to beat faster and increases blood vessel constriction.

## Common Misconceptions
**Myth:** Hypertension is only a concern for older adults — **Fact:** Hypertension can affect individuals of all ages, with approximately 1 in 10 children and adolescents having elevated blood pressure (American Academy of Pediatrics). 
**Myth:** Hypertension is solely caused by genetic factors — **Fact:** While genetics can play a role, lifestyle factors such as diet, physical activity, and stress also contribute to the development of hypertension, with a diet high in sodium and low in potassium increasing blood pressure (National Institutes of Health). 
**Myth:** Hypertension is not a significant concern for individuals with normal blood pressure readings — **Fact:** Even individuals with normal blood pressure readings can be at risk for hypertension if they have other risk factors, such as obesity or a family history of hypertension, with the **Framingham Heart Study** showing that individuals with a family history of hypertension are more likely to develop hypertension (Framingham Heart Study).

## In Practice
The city of **Jacksonville, Florida**, has implemented a comprehensive approach to reducing hypertension in its residents, including partnering with local healthcare providers to offer free blood pressure screenings and providing education on healthy lifestyle habits, such as regular physical activity and a balanced diet. The **Jacksonville Jaguars** football team has also partnered with the city to promote awareness of hypertension and encourage fans to get their blood pressure checked, with the team's stadium featuring a **blood pressure kiosk** where fans can get their blood pressure checked for free. With an estimated 40% of adults in Jacksonville having hypertension (Jacksonville City Council), the city's efforts aim to reduce this number and improve overall health outcomes for its residents, with a goal of reducing hypertension rates by 10% over the next 5 years (Jacksonville City Council).
