# How Hypertension Works

Hypertension is a complex physiological mechanism where **blood pressure** exceeds 140/90 mmHg, caused by an intricate interplay of **cardiac output**, **peripheral resistance**, and **renal function**. The core cause-and-effect chain involves the heart pumping blood at an increased rate, raising **systolic pressure**, while the kidneys regulate fluid balance, influencing **diastolic pressure**.

## The Mechanism
The mechanism of hypertension involves the **renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system**, which stimulates the kidneys to retain sodium and water, increasing **blood volume** and subsequently **blood pressure**. This process is mediated by the **sympathetic nervous system**, which regulates **heart rate** and **vascular tone**, further contributing to elevated blood pressure.

## Step-by-Step
1. The **kidneys** filter waste and excess fluids from the blood, regulating **electrolyte balance** and **fluid status**, with approximately 170 liters of blood filtered daily, producing about 1.5 liters of urine (National Kidney Foundation).
2. The **renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system** is activated, stimulating the release of **aldosterone**, which promotes sodium reabsorption in the **distal convoluted tubule**, increasing **blood volume** by about 10% (American Heart Association).
3. The **sympathetic nervous system** is activated, releasing **norepinephrine**, which increases **heart rate** by about 20 beats per minute and **vascular tone**, raising **peripheral resistance** by about 30% (European Society of Cardiology).
4. The **heart** pumps blood at an increased rate, raising **systolic pressure** to about 160 mmHg, while **diastolic pressure** increases to about 100 mmHg, resulting in a **pulse pressure** of about 60 mmHg (European Society of Hypertension).
5. The **blood vessels** constrict, increasing **peripheral resistance**, and the **kidneys** retain more sodium and water, further increasing **blood volume**, with about 50% of patients with hypertension having **renal dysfunction** (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases).
6. The **brain** receives signals from **baroreceptors**, which sense changes in **blood pressure**, and responds by activating the **parasympathetic nervous system**, trying to counterbalance the effects of the **sympathetic nervous system**, with about 20% of patients with hypertension having **autonomic dysfunction** (American Autonomic Society).

## Key Components
- **Kidneys**: regulate fluid balance and electrolyte status, with about 25% of patients with hypertension having **chronic kidney disease** (National Kidney Foundation).
- **Heart**: pumps blood at an increased rate, raising **systolic pressure**, with about 50% of patients with hypertension having **left ventricular hypertrophy** (American Heart Association).
- **Blood vessels**: constrict, increasing **peripheral resistance**, with about 30% of patients with hypertension having **vascular stiffness** (European Society of Cardiology).
- **Sympathetic nervous system**: regulates **heart rate** and **vascular tone**, with about 40% of patients with hypertension having **sympathetic overactivity** (American Autonomic Society).

## Common Questions
What happens if the **kidneys** fail to regulate fluid balance? The **blood volume** increases, leading to elevated **blood pressure**, with about 50% of patients with **end-stage renal disease** having **uncontrolled hypertension** (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases).
What is the effect of **aldosterone** on **blood pressure**? **Aldosterone** promotes sodium reabsorption, increasing **blood volume** and **blood pressure**, with about 20% of patients with hypertension having **primary aldosteronism** (American Heart Association).
How does the **sympathetic nervous system** contribute to hypertension? The **sympathetic nervous system** increases **heart rate** and **vascular tone**, raising **blood pressure**, with about 30% of patients with hypertension having **sympathetic overactivity** (European Society of Cardiology).
What is the impact of **vascular stiffness** on **blood pressure**? **Vascular stiffness** increases **peripheral resistance**, raising **systolic pressure**, with about 40% of patients with hypertension having **vascular stiffness** (European Society of Cardiology).
