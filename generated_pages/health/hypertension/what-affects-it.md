# What Affects Hypertension

Sodium intake is the single biggest factor affecting **hypertension**, increasing blood pressure by an average of 5-10 mmHg per 1000mg of sodium consumed daily, as seen in the DASH diet study where participants who reduced their sodium intake to 1500mg per day experienced a significant decrease in blood pressure (American Heart Association).

## Main Factors
- **Genetics** — genetic predisposition can increase the risk of developing hypertension by 20-30% in individuals with a family history of the condition, such as those with a mutation in the **angiotensinogen** gene, which increases blood pressure by 10-15 mmHg (Rapp's genetic model).
- **Physical inactivity** — a sedentary lifestyle can increase blood pressure by 5-10 mmHg, as seen in a study of office workers who spent more than 4 hours per day sitting, resulting in a 10% increase in hypertension risk (World Health Organization).
- **Obesity** — excess body weight can increase blood pressure by 10-20 mmHg, with a 10% increase in body weight resulting in a 5-10 mmHg increase in blood pressure, as observed in a study of individuals with a **body mass index (BMI)** of 30 or higher (National Institutes of Health).
- **Smoking** — tobacco use can increase blood pressure by 5-10 mmHg, with a 20% increase in hypertension risk in smokers compared to non-smokers, as seen in a study of smokers who consumed an average of 20 cigarettes per day (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).
- **Diet** — a diet high in **saturated fats** and low in **potassium** can increase blood pressure by 5-10 mmHg, as seen in a study of individuals who consumed a diet consisting of 20% saturated fats and 1000mg of potassium per day, resulting in a 10% increase in hypertension risk (Harvard School of Public Health).
- **Stress** — chronic stress can increase blood pressure by 5-10 mmHg, with a 10% increase in hypertension risk in individuals who experience high levels of stress, as observed in a study of individuals with **chronic stress syndrome** (American Psychological Association).
- **Age** — increasing age can increase blood pressure by 10-20 mmHg per decade, with a 10% increase in hypertension risk per decade of life, as seen in a study of individuals aged 40-60 years (National Institute on Aging).

## How They Interact
The interaction between **physical inactivity** and **obesity** can amplify the risk of hypertension, as seen in a study of individuals who were both physically inactive and obese, resulting in a 20% increase in hypertension risk. The combination of **smoking** and **high sodium intake** can also increase blood pressure, as observed in a study of smokers who consumed an average of 3000mg of sodium per day, resulting in a 15% increase in hypertension risk. Furthermore, the interaction between **stress** and **poor diet** can increase blood pressure, as seen in a study of individuals who experienced high levels of stress and consumed a diet high in **saturated fats**, resulting in a 15% increase in hypertension risk.

## Controllable vs Uncontrollable
The controllable factors affecting hypertension include **physical inactivity**, **obesity**, **smoking**, **diet**, and **stress**, which can be controlled by individuals through lifestyle modifications, such as regular exercise, healthy eating, and stress management. These factors can be influenced by individuals, healthcare providers, and policymakers through education and intervention programs. The uncontrollable factors include **genetics** and **age**, which cannot be changed by individuals. However, individuals with a family history of hypertension or who are at an advanced age can still take steps to reduce their risk by controlling the controllable factors.
