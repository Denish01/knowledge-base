  "content": "There are two main categories of **hypertension**, classified based on their underlying causes and characteristics: primary and secondary hypertension. \n## Main Categories\n- **Primary Hypertension** \u2014 a type of hypertension with no identifiable cause, accounting for approximately 90-95% of all cases, characterized by a gradual increase in blood pressure over time, with the **Framingham Heart Study** being a notable example of research on this condition.\n- **Secondary Hypertension** \u2014 a type of hypertension caused by an underlying medical condition, such as kidney disease or sleep apnea, characterized by a sudden and significant increase in blood pressure, with **pheochromocytoma**, a rare tumor of the adrenal gland, being a specific example.\n- **Pregnancy-Induced Hypertension** \u2014 a type of hypertension that occurs during pregnancy, characterized by high blood pressure and often accompanied by protein in the urine, with **preeclampsia** being a severe example of this condition.\n- **White Coat Hypertension** \u2014 a type of hypertension that occurs in a clinical setting, characterized by elevated blood pressure readings in a medical office, but normal readings at home, with the **American Heart Association** recognizing this as a distinct condition.\n- **Resistant Hypertension** \u2014 a type of hypertension that does not respond to treatment with standard medications and lifestyle changes, characterized by blood pressure that remains high despite the use of multiple medications, with **aldosterone antagonists** being a specific example of a medication used to treat this condition.\n\n## Comparison Table\n| Category | Cause | Blood Pressure Pattern | Example |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Primary Hypertension | Unknown | Gradual increase | Framingham Heart Study |\n| Secondary Hypertension | Underlying medical condition | Sudden and significant increase | Pheochromocytoma |\n| Pregnancy-Induced Hypertension | Pregnancy | High blood pressure and protein in urine | Preeclampsia |\n| White Coat Hypertension | Clinical setting | Elevated in office, normal at home | American Heart Association |\n| Resistant Hypertension | Unknown | High despite multiple medications | Aldosterone antagonists |\n\n## How They Relate\nThe categories of hypertension are not mutually exclusive, and patients may experience multiple types of hypertension simultaneously. For example, a patient with **primary hypertension** may also experience **white coat hypertension** due to anxiety in a clinical setting. **Secondary hypertension** often has a sudden onset, which can be mistaken for **resistant hypertension** if the underlying cause is not identified. Additionally, **pregnancy-induced hypertension** can increase the risk of developing **primary hypertension** later in life. Accurate diagnosis and distinction between these categories are crucial for effective treatment and management of hypertension.",
