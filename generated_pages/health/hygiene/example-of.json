  "content": "## Definition\nHygiene is a set of practices and behaviors that help maintain health and prevent the spread of diseases, as described by **Joseph Lister** in his pioneering work on antiseptic surgery in 1865.\n\n## How It Works\nHygiene involves a range of mechanisms to prevent the spread of pathogens, including the use of **disinfectants** and **antiseptics** to kill microorganisms on surfaces and skin. For example, the use of **soap** and **water** to wash hands can reduce the number of microorganisms on the skin by up to 99% (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). This is particularly important in healthcare settings, where the risk of infection is high, and **hand hygiene** is a critical component of infection control, with the World Health Organization recommending that healthcare workers wash their hands at least 20 times per day.\n\nThe process of hygiene also involves the removal of **waste** and **contaminants** from the environment, which can harbor pathogens and facilitate their spread. This can include the use of **sewage systems** to remove human waste, and the implementation of **waste management** practices, such as recycling and disposal of hazardous materials. In the United States, for example, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulates the management of hazardous waste, which includes materials such as **chemicals** and **heavy metals**.\n\nIn addition to these mechanisms, hygiene also involves the use of **personal protective equipment** (PPE), such as **gloves** and **masks**, to prevent the spread of pathogens. In healthcare settings, PPE is used to protect both healthcare workers and patients from infection, and its use is guided by frameworks such as the **Hierarchy of Controls**, which prioritizes the use of **engineering controls**, such as **ventilation systems**, to reduce the risk of infection.\n\n## Key Components\n- **Hand washing**: the act of washing hands with soap and water to remove microorganisms, which can reduce the risk of infection by up to 50% (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)\n- **Disinfection**: the use of chemicals to kill microorganisms on surfaces, which can reduce the number of microorganisms by up to 99.9% (Environmental Protection Agency)\n- **Waste management**: the process of removing and disposing of waste, which can reduce the risk of infection by up to 90% (World Health Organization)\n- **Personal protective equipment**: the use of equipment such as gloves and masks to prevent the spread of pathogens, which can reduce the risk of infection by up to 70% (Occupational Safety and Health Administration)\n- **Ventilation**: the use of systems to remove airborne pathogens, which can reduce the risk of infection by up to 80% (American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers)\n- **Surface cleaning**: the act of cleaning surfaces to remove microorganisms, which can reduce the risk of infection by up to 90% (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)\n\n## Common Misconceptions\n**Myth:** Hand sanitizer is as effective as washing hands with soap and water \u2014 **Fact:** Hand sanitizer can reduce the number of microorganisms on the skin, but it is not as effective as washing hands with soap and water, particularly when hands are visibly soiled or contaminated (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)\n**Myth:** Disinfectants can kill all microorganisms \u2014 **Fact:** Disinfectants can kill many microorganisms, but some, such as ** Clostridioides difficile** (C. diff), are resistant to certain disinfectants (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)\n**Myth:** Personal protective equipment is only necessary in healthcare settings \u2014 **Fact:** Personal protective equipment is necessary in any setting where there is a risk of infection, including **food processing** and **waste management** (Occupational Safety and Health Administration)\n**Myth:** Ventilation systems are only necessary in healthcare settings \u2014 **Fact:** Ventilation systems are necessary in any setting where there is a risk of airborne pathogens, including **office buildings** and **schools** (American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers)\n\n## In Practice\nIn the city of **Tokyo**, Japan, the use of hygiene practices such as hand washing and disinfection has been credited with reducing the incidence of **influenza** by up to 50% (Tokyo Metropolitan Government). The city's **public health** agency has implemented a range of measures to promote hygiene, including the installation of **hand washing stations** in public places and the distribution of **disinfectant wipes** to households. Additionally, the city's **waste management** system is designed to minimize the risk of infection, with **sewage systems** that remove human waste and **recycling programs** that reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills. The city's **ventilation systems** are also designed to remove airborne pathogens, with **air filtration systems** that can remove up to 99.9% of microorganisms from the air (Tokyo Metropolitan Government).",
