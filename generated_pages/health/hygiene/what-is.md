# What Is Hygiene?

Hygiene is the practice of maintaining cleanliness and preventing the spread of diseases, as first described by **Hippocrates** in his work "On Airs, Waters, and Places" around 400 BCE.

## Definition
Hygiene refers to the set of practices and conditions that help maintain the health and well-being of individuals and communities, encompassing personal hygiene, environmental hygiene, and public health measures, as outlined in the **World Health Organization's** (WHO) definition of hygiene.

## How It Works
The mechanisms of hygiene involve the removal or destruction of pathogens, such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi, from the environment and the human body. This can be achieved through **hand washing**, which is considered one of the most effective measures to prevent the spread of diseases, with the **Centers for Disease Control and Prevention** (CDC) recommending hand washing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. The **WHO** recommends hand washing with soap and water as a critical measure to prevent the spread of diseases, particularly in healthcare settings, where **hand hygiene** compliance rates are closely monitored.

The environmental aspects of hygiene involve the proper disposal of waste, the maintenance of clean water supplies, and the control of **vector-borne diseases**, such as malaria and dengue fever, which are spread by insects like mosquitoes. The **United Nations Children's Fund** (UNICEF) estimates that approximately 2.3 billion people worldwide lack access to basic sanitation facilities, highlighting the need for improved hygiene practices in these communities. In addition, the **WHO** has developed guidelines for the safe management of **excreta and wastewater**, which includes the use of **septic tanks** and **wastewater treatment plants** to prevent the spread of diseases.

The practice of hygiene also involves the use of **disinfectants** and **sterilization** techniques to kill or remove pathogens from surfaces and equipment. The **Occupational Safety and Health Administration** (OSHA) recommends the use of **disinfectants** that are registered with the **Environmental Protection Agency** (EPA) to ensure their effectiveness against a wide range of pathogens. Furthermore, the **WHO** has developed guidelines for the **sterilization** of medical equipment, which includes the use of **autoclaves** and **ethylene oxide** to kill bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms.

## Key Components
- **Personal hygiene**: involves practices such as hand washing, bathing, and using clean clothing to prevent the spread of diseases, with the **American Academy of Pediatrics** recommending daily bathing for children to maintain good hygiene.
- **Environmental hygiene**: involves the proper disposal of waste, the maintenance of clean water supplies, and the control of vector-borne diseases, with the **EPA** estimating that the average American generates about 4.4 pounds of trash per day.
- **Public health measures**: involves the implementation of policies and programs to promote hygiene practices, such as **vaccination** programs and **disease surveillance**, with the **CDC** reporting that vaccination programs have prevented an estimated 732,000 to 2.5 million deaths in the United States between 1994 and 2013.
- **Infection control**: involves the use of practices such as **isolation** and **quarantine** to prevent the spread of diseases, particularly in healthcare settings, with the **WHO** recommending the use of **personal protective equipment** (PPE) to prevent the spread of diseases.
- **Water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH)**: involves the provision of clean water, sanitation facilities, and hygiene practices to prevent the spread of diseases, with the **WHO** estimating that every dollar invested in WASH generates an average return of $4.30 in economic benefits.
- **Food safety**: involves the handling, preparation, and storage of food to prevent the spread of diseases, with the **FDA** estimating that foodborne illnesses affect approximately 48 million people in the United States each year.

## Common Misconceptions
**Myth:** Hand sanitizers are more effective than hand washing with soap and water. **Fact:** The **CDC** recommends hand washing with soap and water as the preferred method of hand hygiene, as hand sanitizers may not be effective against all types of pathogens.
**Myth:** The use of antibiotics is an effective way to prevent the spread of diseases. **Fact:** The **WHO** has warned that the overuse and misuse of antibiotics are contributing to the development of **antibiotic-resistant** bacteria, making them less effective against diseases.
**Myth:** Hygiene practices are only important in healthcare settings. **Fact:** The **WHO** emphasizes the importance of hygiene practices in all settings, including homes, schools, and communities, to prevent the spread of diseases.
**Myth:** The use of disinfectants is sufficient to prevent the spread of diseases. **Fact:** The **EPA** recommends the use of disinfectants in combination with other hygiene practices, such as hand washing and proper cleaning, to prevent the spread of diseases.

## In Practice
In **Sweden**, the government has implemented a national hygiene program to promote good hygiene practices, particularly in schools and healthcare settings, with the **Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare** reporting a significant reduction in the incidence of diseases such as **influenza** and **norovirus**. The program includes the provision of clean water, sanitation facilities, and hygiene education, as well as the implementation of **infection control** measures in healthcare settings. The **WHO** has recognized Sweden's hygiene program as a model for other countries to follow, with the **UNICEF** estimating that the program has resulted in significant economic benefits, including a reduction in **absenteeism** and **presenteeism**.
