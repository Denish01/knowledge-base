  "content": "There are four primary categories of hygiene, organized by their focus on personal, environmental, social, or occupational health. \n\n## Main Categories\n- **Personal Hygiene** \u2014 refers to the practices that individuals adopt to maintain their physical and mental well-being, characterized by habits such as regular handwashing, showering, and brushing teeth, with a notable example being the **Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)** emphasizing the importance of hand hygiene in preventing the spread of diseases.\n- **Environmental Hygiene** \u2014 encompasses the measures taken to maintain a clean and healthy environment, distinguished by efforts to control pollution, manage waste, and prevent the spread of diseases through contaminated water and air, with the **Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)** implementing policies to reduce pollution and promote environmental hygiene.\n- **Social Hygiene** \u2014 focuses on the behaviors and practices that promote health and prevent disease within communities and societies, marked by initiatives such as public health education campaigns, disease surveillance, and community-based interventions, with the **World Health Organization (WHO)** launching social hygiene campaigns to combat infectious diseases like tuberculosis.\n- **Occupational Hygiene** \u2014 refers to the practices and measures implemented in workplaces to prevent occupational diseases and injuries, characterized by risk assessments, hazard control, and worker training, with **Boeing** implementing occupational hygiene practices to reduce worker exposure to hazardous materials and promote a healthy work environment.\n\n## Comparison Table\n| Category | Cost | Scale | Speed of Implementation |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Personal Hygiene | Low | Individual | Immediate |\n| Environmental Hygiene | High | Community/Global | Long-term |\n| Social Hygiene | Medium | Community | Medium-term |\n| Occupational Hygiene | Medium | Workplace | Medium-term |\n\n## How They Relate\nThe categories of hygiene often overlap and feed into each other, with **Personal Hygiene** and **Social Hygiene** being closely linked, as individual hygiene practices can contribute to community health. **Environmental Hygiene** and **Occupational Hygiene** are also interconnected, as a clean and healthy environment is essential for worker health and safety. Notable pairs of categories that are commonly confused include **Personal Hygiene** and **Social Hygiene**, as both focus on health promotion, but at different levels. Additionally, **Environmental Hygiene** and **Occupational Hygiene** are sometimes conflated, despite having distinct focuses on environmental and workplace health, respectively.",
