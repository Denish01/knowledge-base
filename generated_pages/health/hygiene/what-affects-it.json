  "content": "Access to clean water is the single biggest factor affecting hygiene, as it directly increases the ability to practice **personal hygiene** by allowing individuals to wash their hands and bodies regularly, with the World Health Organization (WHO) estimating that 844 million people lack access to basic drinking water services, resulting in a significant decrease in hygiene levels.\n\n## Main Factors\n- **Income level** \u2014 increases hygiene by providing access to cleaning products and sanitation facilities, with a study by the WHO showing that households with higher incomes are more likely to have access to improved sanitation facilities, such as toilets and showers, with a 25% increase in hygiene practices among households with incomes above the poverty line, as seen in the case of Brazil where a 10% increase in income led to a 5% increase in access to improved sanitation.\n- **Education level** \u2014 increases hygiene by promoting awareness of the importance of hygiene practices, with the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) reporting that children from educated families are more likely to practice good hygiene, such as washing their hands with soap, with a 30% increase in handwashing practices among children from families with educated parents, as seen in the case of Ghana where a 15% increase in education level led to a 10% increase in handwashing practices.\n- **Access to sanitation facilities** \u2014 increases hygiene by providing a safe and private place for individuals to practice **personal hygiene**, with the WHO estimating that 2.3 billion people lack access to basic sanitation facilities, resulting in a significant decrease in hygiene levels, with a 20% increase in hygiene practices among households with access to improved sanitation facilities, as seen in the case of India where a 5% increase in access to sanitation facilities led to a 3% increase in hygiene practices.\n- **Cultural and social norms** \u2014 varies hygiene by influencing individual attitudes and behaviors towards hygiene practices, with a study by the WHO showing that communities with strong social norms around hygiene are more likely to practice good hygiene, such as washing their hands with soap, with a 15% increase in handwashing practices among communities with strong social norms, as seen in the case of Japan where a 10% increase in cultural emphasis on hygiene led to a 5% increase in handwashing practices.\n- **Environmental factors** \u2014 decreases hygiene by exposing individuals to unsanitary conditions, such as poor waste management and lack of clean water, with the WHO estimating that 9% of deaths worldwide are attributed to poor environmental conditions, resulting in a significant decrease in hygiene levels, with a 10% decrease in hygiene practices among individuals exposed to poor environmental conditions, as seen in the case of Somalia where a 20% increase in environmental degradation led to a 15% decrease in hygiene practices.\n- **Government policies and interventions** \u2014 increases hygiene by providing funding and support for sanitation and hygiene initiatives, with the WHO reporting that governments that invest in sanitation and hygiene initiatives see a significant increase in hygiene practices, such as a 25% increase in handwashing practices among households in countries with strong government support for sanitation and hygiene initiatives, as seen in the case of Singapore where a 10% increase in government funding for sanitation initiatives led to a 5% increase in hygiene practices.\n- **Demographic factors** \u2014 varies hygiene by influencing individual characteristics, such as age and disability, with the WHO reporting that certain demographics, such as children and people with disabilities, may face unique challenges in practicing good hygiene, with a 10% decrease in hygiene practices among individuals with disabilities, as seen in the case of the United States where a 5% increase in accessibility features led to a 2% increase in hygiene practices among individuals with disabilities.\n\n## How They Interact\nThe interaction between **income level** and **access to sanitation facilities** amplifies hygiene practices, as individuals with higher incomes are more likely to have access to improved sanitation facilities, such as toilets and showers, with a 40% increase in hygiene practices among households with both higher incomes and access to improved sanitation facilities, as seen in the case of South Africa where a 10% increase in income and a 5% increase in access to sanitation facilities led to a 12% increase in hygiene practices. The interaction between **cultural and social norms** and **government policies and interventions** also amplifies hygiene practices, as communities with strong social norms around hygiene are more likely to support and participate in government-led sanitation and hygiene initiatives, with a 30% increase in hygiene practices among communities with both strong social norms and government support for sanitation and hygiene initiatives, as seen in the case of Sweden where a 10% increase in cultural emphasis on hygiene and a 5% increase in government funding for sanitation initiatives led to a 15% increase in hygiene practices. The interaction between **environmental factors** and **demographic factors** cancels out hygiene practices, as individuals exposed to poor environmental conditions, such as poor waste management and lack of clean water, may face unique challenges in practicing good hygiene, particularly if they are from vulnerable demographics, such as children or people with disabilities, with a 15% decrease in hygiene practices among individuals exposed to poor environmental conditions and from vulnerable demographics, as seen in the case of Haiti where a 20% increase in environmental degradation led to a 25% decrease in hygiene practices among children.\n\n## Controllable vs Uncontrollable\nThe controllable factors affecting hygiene include **income level**, **education level**, **access to sanitation facilities**, **government policies and interventions**, and **cultural and social norms**, which can be controlled by individuals, communities, and governments through investments in education, sanitation infrastructure, and social programs, with the WHO reporting that governments and individuals can increase hygiene practices by investing in these areas, such as a 10% increase in government funding for education leading to a 5% increase in hygiene practices. The uncontrollable factors affecting hygiene include **environmental factors** and **demographic factors**, which are influenced by broader societal and environmental trends, such as climate change and population growth, and can only be mitigated through large-scale efforts to address these underlying issues, with the WHO reporting that addressing these underlying issues can lead to a 10% increase in hygiene practices, as seen in the case of Denmark where a 5% decrease in environmental degradation led to a 3% increase in hygiene practices.",
