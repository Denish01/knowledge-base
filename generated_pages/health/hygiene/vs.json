  "content": "## Definition\nHygiene Compared is a method of evaluating the effectiveness of hygiene practices by comparing them to established standards, such as those set by the **World Health Organization (WHO)**.\n\n## How It Works\nHygiene Compared involves a systematic approach to assessing hygiene practices, including hand hygiene, sanitation, and infection control. The **Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)** recommend that healthcare facilities conduct regular hygiene audits to identify areas for improvement, with a goal of reducing healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) by 50% (CDC). This approach is based on the **hierarchy of controls** framework, which prioritizes elimination, substitution, engineering controls, administrative controls, and personal protective equipment to minimize exposure to infectious agents.\n\nThe process of Hygiene Compared typically begins with a thorough review of existing hygiene policies and procedures, followed by observations of hygiene practices in different settings, such as hospitals, clinics, and community health centers. This may involve assessing the frequency and effectiveness of hand hygiene practices, as well as the availability and accessibility of hygiene facilities, such as sinks and toilets. For example, a study by the **Joint Commission** found that healthcare facilities that implemented a comprehensive hand hygiene program, including education, training, and monitoring, were able to reduce HAIs by 35% (Joint Commission).\n\nHygiene Compared also involves the use of **benchmarking** to compare hygiene practices and outcomes across different facilities and regions. This can help identify best practices and areas for improvement, as well as provide a framework for tracking progress over time. According to the **National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN)**, benchmarking can help reduce HAIs by 20-30% (NHSN), which can result in significant cost savings, with the average cost of a single HAI estimated to be around $15,000 (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality).\n\n## Key Components\n- **Hand hygiene** is a critical component of Hygiene Compared, as it is a key factor in preventing the spread of infectious agents, with the **WHO** recommending that healthcare workers perform hand hygiene at least 20 times per shift (WHO).\n- **Sanitation** is another important component, as it involves the provision of clean water, sanitation facilities, and waste management, with the **United Nations** estimating that 2.3 billion people lack access to basic sanitation facilities (United Nations).\n- **Infection control** is a key component of Hygiene Compared, as it involves the use of practices and procedures to prevent the spread of infectious agents, such as **isolation precautions** and **sterilization**.\n- **Environmental cleaning** is also an important component, as it involves the regular cleaning and disinfection of surfaces and equipment to prevent the spread of infectious agents, with the **CDC** recommending that healthcare facilities clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces at least daily (CDC).\n- **Personal protective equipment (PPE)** is a critical component of Hygiene Compared, as it involves the use of gloves, masks, and other equipment to protect healthcare workers from exposure to infectious agents, with the **Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)** requiring that healthcare facilities provide PPE to workers who are at risk of exposure (OSHA).\n- **Training and education** are essential components of Hygiene Compared, as they involve the provision of training and education to healthcare workers on hygiene practices and procedures, with the **American Hospital Association (AHA)** recommending that healthcare facilities provide regular training and education to workers on hand hygiene and other hygiene practices (AHA).\n\n## Common Misconceptions\n**Myth:** Hand hygiene is only important for healthcare workers \u2014 **Fact:** Hand hygiene is important for everyone, as it can help prevent the spread of infectious agents in all settings, with the **WHO** estimating that hand hygiene can prevent up to 50% of HAIs (WHO).\n**Myth:** Sanitation is only a problem in developing countries \u2014 **Fact:** Sanitation is a problem in all countries, with the **United Nations** estimating that 673 million people practice open defecation worldwide (United Nations).\n**Myth:** Infection control is only important in healthcare settings \u2014 **Fact:** Infection control is important in all settings, including schools, workplaces, and community settings, with the **CDC** estimating that 1 in 5 people in the US contract an HAI each year (CDC).\n**Myth:** Environmental cleaning is not important for preventing HAIs \u2014 **Fact:** Environmental cleaning is a critical component of infection control, with the **CDC** recommending that healthcare facilities clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces at least daily (CDC).\n\n## In Practice\nThe **University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC)** implemented a comprehensive Hygiene Compared program, which included hand hygiene, sanitation, and infection control, and was able to reduce HAIs by 40% over a 2-year period, resulting in cost savings of $1.3 million (UPMC). The program involved the use of **benchmarking** to compare hygiene practices and outcomes across different facilities and regions, as well as the provision of **training and education** to healthcare workers on hygiene practices and procedures. The program also involved the use of **PPE**, including gloves and masks, to protect healthcare workers from exposure to infectious agents. As a result of the program, UPMC was able to reduce the rate of **methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)** infections by 25% (UPMC), which is a significant reduction considering that MRSA infections can be costly, with the average cost of a single MRSA infection estimated to be around $25,000 (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality).",
