# Types of Hygiene

There are four primary categories of hygiene, organized by their focus on personal, environmental, social, or occupational health. 

## Main Categories
- **Personal Hygiene** — refers to the practices that individuals adopt to maintain their physical and mental well-being, characterized by habits such as regular handwashing, showering, and brushing teeth, with a notable example being the **Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)** emphasizing the importance of hand hygiene in preventing the spread of diseases.
- **Environmental Hygiene** — encompasses the measures taken to maintain a clean and healthy environment, distinguished by efforts to control pollution, manage waste, and prevent the spread of diseases through contaminated water and air, with the **Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)** implementing policies to reduce pollution and promote environmental hygiene.
- **Social Hygiene** — focuses on the behaviors and practices that promote health and prevent disease within communities and societies, marked by initiatives such as public health education campaigns, disease surveillance, and community-based interventions, with the **World Health Organization (WHO)** launching social hygiene campaigns to combat infectious diseases like tuberculosis.
- **Occupational Hygiene** — refers to the practices and measures implemented in workplaces to prevent occupational diseases and injuries, characterized by risk assessments, hazard control, and worker training, with **Boeing** implementing occupational hygiene practices to reduce worker exposure to hazardous materials and promote a healthy work environment.

## Comparison Table
| Category | Cost | Scale | Speed of Implementation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Personal Hygiene | Low | Individual | Immediate |
| Environmental Hygiene | High | Community/Global | Long-term |
| Social Hygiene | Medium | Community | Medium-term |
| Occupational Hygiene | Medium | Workplace | Medium-term |

## How They Relate
The categories of hygiene often overlap and feed into each other, with **Personal Hygiene** and **Social Hygiene** being closely linked, as individual hygiene practices can contribute to community health. **Environmental Hygiene** and **Occupational Hygiene** are also interconnected, as a clean and healthy environment is essential for worker health and safety. Notable pairs of categories that are commonly confused include **Personal Hygiene** and **Social Hygiene**, as both focus on health promotion, but at different levels. Additionally, **Environmental Hygiene** and **Occupational Hygiene** are sometimes conflated, despite having distinct focuses on environmental and workplace health, respectively.
