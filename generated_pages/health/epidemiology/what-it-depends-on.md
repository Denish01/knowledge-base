# What Epidemiology Depends On

Epidemiology depends on **Statistics** to establish cause-and-effect relationships and calculate disease rates, as seen in the failure to control the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, where lack of statistical analysis hindered understanding of the disease's spread.

## Key Dependencies
- **Statistics** — necessary for calculating disease rates and establishing cause-and-effect relationships, as the absence of statistical analysis in the 2014 Ebola outbreak led to delayed response and increased mortality.
- **Microbiology** — required for understanding disease mechanisms and developing diagnostic tests, as demonstrated by the failure to identify the SARS-CoV-2 virus in early 2020, which hindered development of effective diagnostic tests and slowed response to the pandemic.
- **Demography** — essential for understanding population characteristics and disease distribution, as the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic showed that demographic factors like age and population density significantly influenced disease spread.
- **Clinical Medicine** — necessary for developing treatment protocols and managing disease outbreaks, as the lack of clinical expertise in the 2010 Haiti cholera outbreak led to inadequate treatment and high mortality rates.
- **Data Systems** — required for collecting and analyzing disease surveillance data, as the failure of data systems in the 2014 Ebola outbreak led to delayed detection and response to the outbreak.
- **Sociology** — important for understanding social determinants of health and developing effective public health interventions, as the lack of sociological analysis in the 1980s HIV/AIDS epidemic led to inadequate response to the disease among high-risk populations.

## Priority Order
The dependencies can be ranked from most to least critical as follows:
- **Statistics**, as it underlies all epidemiological analysis and decision-making.
- **Microbiology**, because understanding disease mechanisms is essential for developing diagnostic tests and treatments.
- **Clinical Medicine**, as effective treatment protocols are critical for managing disease outbreaks.
- **Demography**, because understanding population characteristics is necessary for developing targeted public health interventions.
- **Data Systems**, as timely and accurate data are essential for disease surveillance and response.
- **Sociology**, although important, is often secondary to the other dependencies in the immediate response to a disease outbreak.

## Common Gaps
People often overlook the importance of **Data Quality**, assuming that data systems will automatically provide accurate and reliable information, but the failure of data systems in the 2014 Ebola outbreak shows that data quality is critical for effective disease surveillance and response. Another common gap is the assumption of **Universal Access to Healthcare**, which can lead to inadequate response to disease outbreaks in areas with limited healthcare resources, as seen in the 2010 Haiti cholera outbreak.
