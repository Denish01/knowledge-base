# Types of Epidemiology

There are six main categories of epidemiology, organized by the type of study design and the level of analysis, which include **Descriptive Epidemiology**, **Analytic Epidemiology**, **Experimental Epidemiology**, **Molecular Epidemiology**, **Genetic Epidemiology**, and **Social Epidemiology**.

## Main Categories
- **Descriptive Epidemiology** — involves characterizing and summarizing the distribution of disease within populations, as seen in the **Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC)** annual influenza season reports, which provide detailed information on the incidence and prevalence of influenza cases in the United States.
- **Analytic Epidemiology** — aims to identify the causes of diseases and examine the relationships between risk factors and disease outcomes, exemplified by the **Framingham Heart Study**, a long-term cohort study that has investigated the epidemiology of cardiovascular disease in a population of over 5,000 adults.
- **Experimental Epidemiology** — involves the use of randomized controlled trials to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions, such as the **Women's Health Initiative**, a large-scale clinical trial that assessed the effects of hormone replacement therapy on cardiovascular disease and breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women.
- **Molecular Epidemiology** — applies molecular biology techniques to understand the epidemiology of infectious diseases, as illustrated by the **Global Polio Eradication Initiative**, which uses genetic sequencing to track the transmission of poliovirus and inform vaccination strategies.
- **Genetic Epidemiology** — examines the role of genetic factors in the development of diseases, as demonstrated by the **Human Genome Project**, which has enabled researchers to identify genetic variants associated with an increased risk of diseases such as sickle cell anemia and cystic fibrosis.
- **Social Epidemiology** — investigates the relationships between social factors, such as socioeconomic status and education, and health outcomes, as seen in the **Whitehall Study**, a cohort study of British civil servants that has examined the effects of social class on cardiovascular disease risk.

## Comparison Table
| Category | Study Design | Level of Analysis | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Descriptive Epidemiology** | Cross-sectional, case-series | Population-level | CDC influenza season reports |
| **Analytic Epidemiology** | Cohort, case-control | Individual-level | Framingham Heart Study |
| **Experimental Epidemiology** | Randomized controlled trial | Individual-level | Women's Health Initiative |
| **Molecular Epidemiology** | Genetic sequencing, phylogenetic analysis | Molecular-level | Global Polio Eradication Initiative |
| **Genetic Epidemiology** | Genome-wide association study, linkage analysis | Genetic-level | Human Genome Project |
| **Social Epidemiology** | Longitudinal, ecological | Population-level | Whitehall Study |

## How They Relate
The categories of epidemiology are interconnected and often feed into each other, as **Descriptive Epidemiology** provides the foundation for **Analytic Epidemiology**, which in turn informs the design of **Experimental Epidemiology** studies. For example, descriptive epidemiology can identify patterns of disease occurrence, which can then be investigated using analytic epidemiology to identify risk factors, and finally, experimental epidemiology can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions. Additionally, **Molecular Epidemiology** and **Genetic Epidemiology** can provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of disease, which can inform the development of interventions and policies, as seen in the **Human Genome Project**, which has enabled researchers to identify genetic variants associated with an increased risk of diseases. Furthermore, **Social Epidemiology** can examine the social and economic contexts in which diseases occur, which can inform the development of policies and interventions to address health disparities, as illustrated by the **Whitehall Study**, which has examined the effects of social class on cardiovascular disease risk. Specific pairs of categories, such as **Descriptive Epidemiology** and **Analytic Epidemiology**, are commonly confused, but they serve distinct purposes in the field of epidemiology.
