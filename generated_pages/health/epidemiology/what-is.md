# What Is Epidemiology?

## Definition
Epidemiology is the study of the distribution and determinants of health-related events, diseases, or health-related characteristics among populations, developed by John Snow in 1855.

## How It Works
Epidemiology involves the use of **surveillance** and **investigation** to identify and track health problems, with the goal of preventing and controlling disease outbreaks. Epidemiologists use **descriptive epidemiology** to characterize and summarize the distribution of health-related events, and **analytic epidemiology** to examine associations and test hypotheses about the causes of diseases. The **case-control study**, a type of analytic epidemiology, involves comparing people with a specific disease or condition to people without the disease, to identify potential risk factors.

Epidemiologists also use **cohort studies**, which involve following a group of people over time to examine the development of disease, as seen in the **Framingham Heart Study**, which has been ongoing since 1948 and has provided valuable insights into the risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Additionally, epidemiologists use **experimental studies**, such as **randomized controlled trials**, to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions and treatments, like the **Salk polio vaccine trial**, which demonstrated the vaccine's efficacy in preventing polio.

The use of **statistical models**, such as **regression analysis**, allows epidemiologists to control for confounding variables and quantify the relationships between risk factors and disease outcomes. For example, a study of the relationship between **air pollution** and **lung cancer** might use regression analysis to account for the effects of **smoking** and **occupation** on the risk of lung cancer, as seen in a study by the **National Cancer Institute**.

## Key Components
- **Surveillance**: the ongoing, systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of health-related data, which allows for the early detection of disease outbreaks and the monitoring of trends over time, as seen in the **Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC)** surveillance of **influenza**.
- **Investigation**: the process of gathering and analyzing data to identify the causes of a disease outbreak, which involves the use of **laboratory testing** and **interviews** with affected individuals, as seen in the investigation of the **Ebola outbreak** in **West Africa**.
- **Descriptive epidemiology**: the characterization and summary of the distribution of health-related events, which involves the use of **rates** and **ratios** to quantify the occurrence of disease, such as the **incidence rate** of **tuberculosis** in **South Africa**.
- **Analytic epidemiology**: the examination of associations and testing of hypotheses about the causes of diseases, which involves the use of **study designs** such as **case-control studies** and **cohort studies**, as seen in a study of the relationship between **asbestos exposure** and **mesothelioma**.
- **Experimental studies**: the use of **randomized controlled trials** to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions and treatments, which allows for the establishment of **cause-and-effect relationships**, as seen in the **Women's Health Initiative** study of **hormone replacement therapy**.
- **Statistical models**: the use of **mathematical models** to analyze and interpret data, which allows for the control of **confounding variables** and the quantification of relationships between risk factors and disease outcomes, as seen in a study of the relationship between **diabetes** and **cardiovascular disease**.

## Common Misconceptions
**Myth:** Epidemiology is only concerned with the study of infectious diseases — **Fact:** Epidemiology also examines the distribution and determinants of non-infectious diseases, such as **heart disease** and **cancer**, as seen in the **World Health Organization's (WHO)** study of the **global burden of disease**.
**Myth:** Epidemiology is a new field of study — **Fact:** Epidemiology has its roots in the work of **John Snow**, who used epidemiological principles to investigate a cholera outbreak in **London** in 1855.
**Myth:** Epidemiology is only used to study human diseases — **Fact:** Epidemiology is also used to study diseases in **animals**, as seen in the study of **avian influenza** in **poultry**.
**Myth:** Epidemiology is a purely theoretical field — **Fact:** Epidemiology is a highly applied field, with epidemiologists working in **public health agencies**, **hospitals**, and **research institutions** to investigate and control disease outbreaks, as seen in the **CDC's** response to the **COVID-19 pandemic**.

## In Practice
The **CDC** used epidemiological principles to investigate a **salmonella outbreak** in the **United States**, which was linked to **peanut butter** products. The investigation involved the use of **surveillance** and **investigation** to identify the source of the outbreak, and the implementation of **control measures** to prevent further cases. The **CDC** worked with **state and local health agencies** to collect and analyze data, and with **industry partners** to recall contaminated products. The outbreak resulted in **714 reported cases** of salmonella infection, and **9 deaths**, with an estimated **$1 billion** in economic losses. The **CDC's** response to the outbreak demonstrates the practical application of epidemiological principles to investigate and control disease outbreaks.
