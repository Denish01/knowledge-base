  "content": "## Definition\nExercise Compared is a framework used to analyze and compare the physical demands of different exercises, developed by **American Council on Exercise (ACE)**.\n\n## How It Works\nExercise Compared works by categorizing exercises into different intensity levels, based on the energy expenditure required to perform them. The framework uses **metabolic equivalents (METs)**, a unit of measurement that expresses the energy cost of an activity, to quantify the intensity of each exercise. For example, walking at a moderate pace has a MET value of approximately 3-4, while running at a high intensity has a MET value of 8-10 (Compendium of Physical Activities). This allows for a standardized comparison of the energy expenditure required for different exercises.\n\nThe framework also considers other factors, such as the type of muscle contractions involved (e.g., **isometric**, **concentric**, or **eccentric**) and the range of motion required. For instance, exercises like squats and lunges require a large range of motion and engage multiple muscle groups, making them more energetically costly than exercises like bicep curls (National Academy of Sports Medicine). Additionally, Exercise Compared takes into account the **rating of perceived exertion (RPE)**, a subjective measure of how hard an individual feels they are working during an exercise.\n\nThe combination of these factors allows for a comprehensive comparison of the physical demands of different exercises. For example, a study by the **National Institutes of Health (NIH)** found that high-intensity interval training (HIIT) exercises, such as sprint intervals, have a higher energy expenditure and RPE than traditional aerobic exercises, such as jogging (NIH). This information can be used to design more effective exercise programs and to help individuals choose exercises that meet their specific fitness goals.\n\n## Key Components\n- **Intensity**: The energy expenditure required to perform an exercise, measured in METs, which affects the overall physical demands of the exercise and the caloric expenditure.\n- **Muscle contractions**: The type of muscle contractions involved in an exercise (e.g., isometric, concentric, or eccentric), which influences the energy expenditure and muscle engagement.\n- **Range of motion**: The extent of movement required for an exercise, which impacts the energy expenditure and the number of muscle groups engaged.\n- **Rating of perceived exertion (RPE)**: A subjective measure of how hard an individual feels they are working during an exercise, which affects the overall physical demands and the individual's willingness to continue exercising.\n- **Energy expenditure**: The total amount of energy required to perform an exercise, which is influenced by factors such as intensity, muscle contractions, and range of motion.\n- **Caloric expenditure**: The number of calories burned during an exercise, which is affected by factors such as intensity, duration, and individual characteristics (e.g., weight, fitness level).\n\n## Common Misconceptions\n**Myth:** Exercise Compared is only used for comparing aerobic exercises \u2014 **Fact:** Exercise Compared can be used to compare a wide range of exercises, including strength training and flexibility exercises (American Council on Exercise).\n**Myth:** The energy expenditure of an exercise is solely determined by its intensity \u2014 **Fact:** Other factors, such as muscle contractions and range of motion, also influence the energy expenditure of an exercise (National Academy of Sports Medicine).\n**Myth:** Exercise Compared is only relevant for athletes or highly trained individuals \u2014 **Fact:** Exercise Compared can be used by anyone looking to design an effective exercise program or compare the physical demands of different exercises (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).\n**Myth:** The RPE is an objective measure of exercise intensity \u2014 **Fact:** The RPE is a subjective measure that can vary between individuals and is influenced by factors such as fitness level and psychological state (American College of Sports Medicine).\n\n## In Practice\nThe city of **New York** has implemented a physical activity program for its residents, which uses Exercise Compared to design and promote exercises that meet the needs of different populations. For example, the program offers **yoga** classes, which have a low-to-moderate intensity and are suitable for older adults or individuals with mobility limitations. The program also offers **HIIT** classes, which have a high intensity and are designed for younger adults or individuals looking to improve their cardiovascular fitness. By using Exercise Compared, the program can ensure that the exercises offered are safe, effective, and meet the specific needs of the participants. The program has been successful, with over **10,000** residents participating in the first year, and has resulted in significant improvements in physical activity levels and overall health (New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene).",
