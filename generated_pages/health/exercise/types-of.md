# Types of Exercise

There are six main categories of exercise, organized by their primary physiological effects: **Aerobic Exercise**, **Anaerobic Exercise**, **Flexibility Exercise**, **Balance Exercise**, **Plyometric Exercise**, and **High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)**. 

## Main Categories
- **Aerobic Exercise** — involves low-to-moderate intensity movements that raise the heart rate and improve cardiovascular health, such as jogging, with a notable example being the **Boston Marathon**. 
- **Anaerobic Exercise** — consists of high-intensity, short-duration activities that build muscle mass and increase strength, such as weightlifting, with **Olympic powerlifting** being a prominent example.
- **Flexibility Exercise** — encompasses movements designed to enhance range of motion and reduce stiffness, such as **yoga**, with **Bikram Yoga** being a well-known style.
- **Balance Exercise** — focuses on improving stability and equilibrium, often through activities like **Tai Chi**, which has been practiced for centuries in China.
- **Plyometric Exercise** — involves explosive, high-intensity movements that improve muscular power, such as **box jumps**, commonly used in **NFL training programs**.
- **High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)** — a workout method that alternates between periods of intense exercise and brief rest periods, with **Insanity workouts** being a popular example.

## Comparison Table
| Category | Cost | Scale | Speed | Risk |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Aerobic Exercise | Low-Moderate | Individual-Group | Moderate | Low-Moderate |
| Anaerobic Exercise | Moderate-High | Individual | Fast | High |
| Flexibility Exercise | Low | Individual | Slow | Low |
| Balance Exercise | Low | Individual | Slow | Low |
| Plyometric Exercise | Moderate | Individual-Group | Fast | High |
| High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) | Moderate | Individual-Group | Fast | High |

## How They Relate
The categories often overlap, with **Aerobic Exercise** and **Anaerobic Exercise** frequently being combined in **HIIT** workouts to achieve both cardiovascular and strength benefits. **Plyometric Exercise** is sometimes incorporated into **Anaerobic Exercise** routines to enhance power. **Flexibility Exercise** and **Balance Exercise** are often performed together, as improved flexibility can enhance balance and reduce the risk of injury. **Yoga**, for example, combines elements of **Flexibility Exercise**, **Balance Exercise**, and **Aerobic Exercise**, making it a comprehensive workout. Additionally, **Tai Chi** shares similarities with **Balance Exercise** and **Aerobic Exercise**, as it requires slow, controlled movements that improve balance and raise the heart rate.
