# What Affects Exercise

Age is the single biggest factor affecting exercise, as it decreases physical ability and **muscle mass** by 30-40% between the ages of 20 and 60 (American College of Sports Medicine).

## Main Factors
- **Genetics** — affects exercise by influencing **metabolic rate**, increases or decreases physical ability, with a magnitude of 20-50% variation in **VO2 max** between individuals with different genetic profiles, as seen in the case of Olympic athlete Usain Bolt, who has a genetic variation that enhances his **fast-twitch muscle fibers**.
- **Nutrition** — affects exercise by providing **energy** and **macronutrients**, increases exercise performance by 10-20% when adequate **carbohydrate stores** are available, as demonstrated by a study of Tour de France cyclists who consume 6,000-8,000 calories daily (International Journal of Sports Nutrition).
- **Sleep** — affects exercise by influencing **recovery** and **inflammation**, decreases exercise performance by 5-15% when **sleep deprivation** occurs, as seen in the case of NFL players who experience reduced **reaction time** after a night of poor sleep (National Sleep Foundation).
- **Injury** — affects exercise by limiting **physical activity**, decreases exercise frequency by 20-50% when **overuse injuries** occur, as demonstrated by a study of marathon runners who experience **shin splints** and are forced to reduce their training volume (American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons).
- **Motivation** — affects exercise by influencing **adherence**, increases exercise frequency by 10-30% when **intrinsic motivation** is high, as seen in the case of runners who participate in charity events and experience a sense of **personal fulfillment** (Self-Determination Theory).
- **Environment** — affects exercise by providing **access** to facilities and **social support**, increases exercise frequency by 5-15% when **safe outdoor spaces** are available, as demonstrated by a study of urban parks and their impact on **physical activity levels** (World Health Organization).
- **Socioeconomic status** — affects exercise by influencing **access** to resources and **healthcare**, decreases exercise frequency by 10-20% when **low socioeconomic status** is a factor, as seen in the case of communities with limited **recreational facilities** and **health education** (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).

## How They Interact
The interaction between **genetics** and **nutrition** can amplify or cancel each other, as seen in the case of an individual with a genetic variation that enhances **lactate threshold**, but also has a **gluten intolerance** that reduces their ability to absorb **carbohydrates**. For example, a study of endurance athletes found that those with a genetic variation that enhanced **lactate threshold** were able to perform at a higher intensity when consuming a **gluten-free diet** (Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research).
The interaction between **sleep** and **injury** can also have a significant impact on exercise, as **sleep deprivation** can increase the risk of **overuse injuries** by 10-20%, as seen in the case of NFL players who experience **concussions** and are forced to miss games due to **post-concussion syndrome** (National Football League).
The interaction between **motivation** and **environment** can also influence exercise, as **intrinsic motivation** can increase exercise frequency by 10-30% when **safe outdoor spaces** are available, as demonstrated by a study of urban parks and their impact on **physical activity levels** (World Health Organization).

## Controllable vs Uncontrollable
The controllable factors include **nutrition**, **sleep**, **motivation**, and **environment**, which can be influenced by individuals through **dietary choices**, **sleep habits**, **goal setting**, and **access to recreational facilities**. For example, an individual can control their **nutrition** by consuming a **balanced diet** that includes **lean protein**, **complex carbohydrates**, and **healthy fats**, as recommended by the **American Heart Association**. The uncontrollable factors include **genetics**, **injury**, and **socioeconomic status**, which can be influenced by factors such as **family history**, **accidents**, and **economic conditions**.
