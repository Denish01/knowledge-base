  "content": "The notion that sanitation systems in developed countries are completely separate from stormwater drainage systems is a widespread misconception. \n## Misconceptions\n- **Myth:** Sanitation systems and stormwater drainage systems are always separate in developed countries.\n- **Fact:** Many cities, including older parts of New York City and Chicago, still use combined sewer systems, where sewage and stormwater flow through the same pipes, with approximately 772 combined sewer overflow events occurring annually in the United States (US Environmental Protection Agency).\n- **Source of confusion:** This myth persists due to outdated textbooks that oversimplify urban infrastructure, failing to account for the historical development of sewer systems.\n\n- **Myth:** Handwashing with soap is only necessary after using the bathroom.\n- **Fact:** The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend handwashing with soap before and after preparing food, as well as after blowing one's nose, coughing or sneezing, to prevent the spread of illnesses like influenza, which affects approximately 8% of the US population annually (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).\n- **Source of confusion:** This misconception stems from a narrow focus on bathroom hygiene, neglecting the broader importance of handwashing in preventing the transmission of illnesses.\n\n- **Myth:** Sanitation infrastructure is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions.\n- **Fact:** While sanitation infrastructure does produce some greenhouse gas emissions, the wastewater treatment process accounts for approximately 2% of total energy consumption in the United States, with the majority of emissions coming from the energy sector, which produces 25% of global greenhouse gas emissions (International Energy Agency).\n- **Source of confusion:** The misconception arises from misinformation in media narratives that exaggerate the environmental impact of sanitation systems.\n\n- **Myth:** All developing countries lack access to basic sanitation facilities.\n- **Fact:** Significant progress has been made, with countries like Vietnam and Thailand achieving over 90% access to improved sanitation facilities, according to the World Health Organization, which reports that 4.2 billion people worldwide now have access to improved sanitation facilities.\n- **Source of confusion:** This myth is perpetuated by outdated reports and a lack of awareness about recent developments in global sanitation efforts.\n\n- **Myth:** Private companies are better equipped to manage sanitation services than public entities.\n- **Fact:** Publicly owned and operated sanitation systems, such as those in Copenhagen and Vancouver, have successfully implemented efficient and sustainable waste management practices, with Copenhagen's system reducing carbon emissions by 70% since 1995 (Copenhagen City Council).\n- **Source of confusion:** The misconception is fueled by a biased media narrative that favors privatization, often citing flawed comparisons between public and private sector performance.\n\n- **Myth:** Sanitation is solely a matter of personal hygiene.\n- **Fact:** Sanitation is closely tied to public health, with proper waste management and water treatment essential for preventing the spread of waterborne diseases like cholera, which affects approximately 1.3 million people annually worldwide (World Health Organization).\n- **Source of confusion:** This misconception arises from a narrow focus on individual behavior, neglecting the critical role of community-wide sanitation infrastructure in maintaining public health.\n\n- **Myth:** Low-cost sanitation solutions are ineffective and unreliable.\n- **Fact:** Simple, low-cost technologies like pit latrines and septic tanks can be effective in reducing the spread of diseases when properly constructed and maintained, with a study by the World Bank finding that every dollar invested in sanitation generates an average return of $5.50 in economic benefits.\n- **Source of confusion:** The misconception is perpetuated by a lack of awareness about successful low-cost sanitation initiatives and the benefits they can provide.\n\n## Quick Reference\n- Myth: Separate sanitation and stormwater systems \u2192 Fact: Many cities use combined sewer
