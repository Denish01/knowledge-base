# What Is Sanitation?

Sanitation is the control of human waste and other contaminants to prevent disease and promote health, as first emphasized by **Edwin Chadwick** in his 1842 report on The Sanitary Condition of the Labouring Population.

## Definition
Sanitation refers to the provision of facilities and services for the safe disposal of human waste and other contaminants, including **wastewater treatment**, solid waste management, and **vector control**, with the goal of preventing disease and promoting health.

## How It Works
The sanitation process involves the collection, transportation, treatment, and disposal of human waste and other contaminants. In urban areas, this is typically achieved through the use of **sewerage systems**, which can serve up to 90% of the population in developed countries, such as the United States, where the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) oversees wastewater treatment. In rural areas, **on-site sanitation** systems, such as septic tanks and pit latrines, are more common, with approximately 25% of the global population relying on these systems (World Health Organization). The **Multiple Barrier Approach**, developed by the EPA, is a framework for ensuring the safe treatment and disposal of wastewater, and involves physical, chemical, and biological processes to remove contaminants.

The effectiveness of sanitation systems depends on a range of factors, including the type and quality of infrastructure, the availability of **water supply**, and the level of community engagement and education. In **low-income countries**, where sanitation infrastructure is often limited, **community-led total sanitation** (CLTS) approaches have been shown to be effective in improving sanitation outcomes, with a study in **Bangladesh** finding that CLTS programs can increase access to improved sanitation facilities by up to 80% (WaterAid). Sanitation systems also have significant economic benefits, with the World Bank estimating that every dollar invested in sanitation generates an average return of $5.50 in economic benefits.

The sanitation sector is also subject to a range of challenges and risks, including **climate change**, which can contaminate water sources and disrupt sanitation infrastructure, and **population growth**, which can increase the demand for sanitation services and put pressure on existing infrastructure. In response to these challenges, many countries are investing in **sustainable sanitation** solutions, such as **decentralized wastewater treatment** systems, which can provide safe and reliable sanitation services while minimizing environmental impacts.

## Key Components
- **Wastewater treatment**: removes contaminants from wastewater, with physical, chemical, and biological processes used to achieve removal efficiencies of up to 99% (EPA).
- **Solid waste management**: involves the collection, transportation, and disposal of solid waste, with **recycling** and **composting** programs used to minimize waste sent to landfills, and the EPA estimating that recycling can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 117 million metric tons.
- **Vector control**: prevents the spread of diseases through **mosquitoes** and other **vectors**, with **insecticide-treated bed nets** and **indoor residual spraying** used to control vector populations, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimating that these interventions can reduce malaria cases by up to 50%.
- **Water supply**: provides safe and reliable access to water for drinking, cooking, and hygiene, with the WHO estimating that access to improved water supply can reduce the risk of diarrheal disease by up to 25%.
- **Community engagement**: promotes awareness and behavior change through education and outreach programs, with a study in **Ghana** finding that community-led sanitation programs can increase access to improved sanitation facilities by up to 60% (UNICEF).
- **Infrastructure**: provides the physical systems and facilities for sanitation, including **sewerage systems**, **wastewater treatment plants**, and **solid waste management facilities**, with the American Society of Civil Engineers estimating that the United States needs to invest up to $1 trillion in sanitation infrastructure by 2025.

## Common Misconceptions
- **Myth:** Sanitation is only a problem in developing countries — **Fact:** Sanitation is a global issue, with the EPA estimating that up to 10% of the population in the United States lacks access to improved sanitation facilities.
- **Myth:** Sanitation is only about wastewater treatment — **Fact:** Sanitation encompasses a range of activities, including solid waste management, vector control, and community engagement, with the WHO estimating that these activities can reduce the risk of disease by up to 50%.
- **Myth:** Sanitation is a low-priority issue — **Fact:** Sanitation is a critical issue, with the World Bank estimating that every dollar invested in sanitation generates an average return of $5.50 in economic benefits, and the CDC estimating that sanitation interventions can reduce the risk of disease by up to 75%.
- **Myth:** Sanitation is a technical issue that can be solved through infrastructure alone — **Fact:** Sanitation is a complex issue that requires a range of social, economic, and technical solutions, including community engagement, education, and behavior change, with a study in **India** finding that community-led sanitation programs can increase access to improved sanitation facilities by up to 80% (WaterAid).

## In Practice
In **Kenya**, the government has implemented a range of sanitation initiatives, including the construction of **decentralized wastewater treatment** systems and the promotion of **community-led total sanitation** (CLTS) approaches. These initiatives have resulted in significant improvements in sanitation outcomes, with the WHO estimating that access to improved sanitation facilities has increased by up to 20% since 2010. The **Nairobi Water and Sewerage Company** has also invested in **wastewater treatment** infrastructure, including the construction of a new wastewater treatment plant that can serve up to 500,000 people, with the plant using a combination of physical, chemical, and biological processes to remove contaminants and achieve removal efficiencies of up to 95% (Nairobi Water and Sewerage Company). The company has also implemented a range of **sustainable sanitation** solutions, including **biogas generation** and **fertilizer production**, which can provide additional economic and environmental benefits, with the company estimating that these solutions can generate up to $1 million in annual revenue.
