# How Sanitation Works

Sanitation works through a complex mechanism involving the removal and treatment of **wastewater** and **solid waste** to prevent the spread of diseases and maintain public health.

## The Mechanism
The core cause-and-effect chain of sanitation involves the collection of wastewater and solid waste, treatment through physical, chemical, and biological processes, and eventual disposal or reuse, resulting in a significant reduction of **pathogens** and **pollutants**. This process requires a continuous flow of **water** and **energy** to operate effectively, with the World Health Organization (WHO) estimating that every dollar invested in sanitation generates an average return of $5.50 in economic benefits (WHO).

## Step-by-Step
1. **Wastewater collection**: Wastewater from households, industries, and institutions is collected through a network of **sewers** and **drains**, with an average flow rate of 100-200 liters per person per day, and transported to a treatment plant, where it undergoes physical treatment, such as **screening** and **grinding**, to remove large objects and debris.
2. **Primary treatment**: The wastewater then undergoes primary treatment, which involves the removal of **suspended solids** and **organic matter** through **sedimentation** and **floatation**, resulting in a 30-50% reduction of **biochemical oxygen demand (BOD)**.
3. **Secondary treatment**: The wastewater then undergoes secondary treatment, which involves the removal of **dissolved organic matter** through **aerobic** and **anaerobic** processes, resulting in a 80-90% reduction of BOD, with the help of **microorganisms** such as **bacteria** and **protozoa**.
4. **Tertiary treatment**: The wastewater may then undergo tertiary treatment, which involves the removal of **nutrients** such as **nitrogen** and **phosphorus** through **chemical precipitation** and **biological processes**, resulting in a 90-95% reduction of **total phosphorus**, with the use of **aluminum sulfate** and **lime**.
5. **Disinfection**: The treated wastewater is then disinfected through **chlorination** or **ultraviolet (UV) light** to remove any remaining pathogens, resulting in a 99.9% reduction of **Escherichia coli (E. coli)**.
6. **Reuse or disposal**: The treated wastewater is then either reused for **irrigation**, **industrial processes**, or **aquatic restoration**, or disposed of through **surface water** or **groundwater**, with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimating that every year, over 1.5 billion gallons of treated wastewater are reused in the United States.

## Key Components
- **Sewers** and **drains**: collect and transport wastewater to the treatment plant, with a average lifespan of 50-100 years.
- **Pumps** and **pipes**: transport wastewater and treated water, with a average flow rate of 10-100 meters per second.
- **Treatment plants**: remove pollutants and pathogens from wastewater, with a average capacity of 10-100 million gallons per day.
- **Energy sources**: power the treatment process, such as **electricity** and **natural gas**, with an average energy consumption of 0.5-1.5 kilowatt-hours per cubic meter of treated water.

## Common Questions
What happens if the treatment plant fails? If the treatment plant fails, untreated wastewater can enter the environment, causing **water pollution** and **public health risks**, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimating that every year, over 1 million people in the United States get sick from **waterborne diseases**. 
What is the impact of sanitation on the environment? Sanitation has a significant impact on the environment, with the removal of pollutants and pathogens from wastewater helping to maintain **water quality** and **ecosystem health**, with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimating that every year, over 10 million tons of pollutants are removed from wastewater.
How much energy is required for sanitation? The energy required for sanitation varies depending on the treatment process, but on average, it requires around 0.5-1.5 kilowatt-hours per cubic meter of treated water, with the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimating that the global energy demand for sanitation will increase by 20% by 2030.
What are the economic benefits of sanitation? Sanitation has significant economic benefits, with the WHO estimating that every dollar invested in sanitation generates an average return of $5.50 in economic benefits, with the World Bank estimating that the global economic benefits of sanitation are around $350 billion per year.
