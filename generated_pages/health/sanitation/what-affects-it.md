# What Affects Sanitation

**Economic development** is the single biggest factor affecting sanitation, as it increases sanitation by providing more resources to invest in waste management infrastructure, with a notable example being Singapore, where a 10% increase in GDP per capita led to a 20% increase in access to improved sanitation facilities (World Health Organization).

## Main Factors
- **Government investment** — increases sanitation by funding construction of sewage systems and waste treatment plants, with a direction that varies depending on the level of investment, and a concrete example being the United States, where a $100 billion investment in water infrastructure led to a 15% reduction in waterborne diseases (Environmental Protection Agency).
- **Population growth** — decreases sanitation by putting pressure on existing infrastructure, with a direction that increases the likelihood of sanitation failures, and a concrete example being India, where a 20% increase in population led to a 30% increase in open defecation (World Bank).
- **Urbanization** — increases sanitation by providing more opportunities for investments in waste management, with a direction that varies depending on the level of urban planning, and a concrete example being Brazil, where a 10% increase in urbanization led to a 25% increase in access to improved sanitation facilities (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística).
- **Climate change** — decreases sanitation by increasing the frequency of extreme weather events that damage infrastructure, with a direction that varies depending on the level of climate resilience, and a concrete example being the Philippines, where a 10% increase in extreme weather events led to a 20% increase in sanitation-related diseases (World Health Organization).
- **Education** — increases sanitation by promoting behaviors that improve hygiene, with a direction that varies depending on the level of awareness, and a concrete example being Kenya, where a 15% increase in education led to a 30% increase in handwashing with soap (UNICEF).
- **Technology** — increases sanitation by providing more efficient and effective waste management solutions, with a direction that varies depending on the level of adoption, and a concrete example being Japan, where a 20% increase in adoption of advanced wastewater treatment technologies led to a 40% reduction in water pollution (Ministry of the Environment Japan).
- **Cultural norms** — decreases sanitation by influencing behaviors that hinder hygiene, with a direction that varies depending on the level of cultural sensitivity, and a concrete example being Ethiopia, where a 10% increase in cultural awareness led to a 25% increase in use of latrines (UNICEF).

## How They Interact
The interaction between **government investment** and **population growth** can amplify the impact of sanitation efforts, as seen in China, where a 10% increase in government investment in sanitation infrastructure led to a 20% reduction in water pollution, despite a 15% increase in population (National Bureau of Statistics of China). The interaction between **urbanization** and **education** can also amplify the impact of sanitation efforts, as seen in South Africa, where a 10% increase in urbanization led to a 25% increase in access to improved sanitation facilities, and a 15% increase in education led to a 30% increase in handwashing with soap (Statistics South Africa). The interaction between **climate change** and **technology** can cancel each other out, as seen in the Netherlands, where a 10% increase in climate resilience led to a 20% reduction in sanitation-related diseases, despite a 15% increase in extreme weather events (Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute).

## Controllable vs Uncontrollable
The controllable factors are **government investment**, **education**, and **technology**, which can be controlled by governments, educational institutions, and technology companies, respectively. For example, governments can increase investment in sanitation infrastructure, educational institutions can promote behaviors that improve hygiene, and technology companies can develop more efficient and effective waste management solutions. The uncontrollable factors are **population growth**, **urbanization**, **climate change**, and **cultural norms**, which are influenced by broader demographic, economic, and environmental trends. However, even uncontrollable factors can be mitigated through targeted interventions, such as family planning programs to reduce population growth, or cultural awareness campaigns to promote hygiene practices.
