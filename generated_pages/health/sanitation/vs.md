# Sanitation Compared

Sanitation Compared is a framework for evaluating the effectiveness of different sanitation systems, considering factors such as cost, environmental impact, and public health outcomes, developed by the **World Health Organization (WHO)**.

## Definition
Sanitation Compared is a systematic approach to assessing sanitation systems, originating from the work of **Engineer Joseph Bazalgette**, who designed the first modern sewer system in London in 1858.

## How It Works
The Sanitation Compared framework involves a comprehensive analysis of a sanitation system's technical, financial, and social aspects, using **Ricardo's comparative advantage model** to evaluate the efficiency of different systems. This approach considers the **total cost of ownership**, including capital expenditures, operating costs, and maintenance expenses, as well as the **environmental impact**, such as greenhouse gas emissions and water pollution, with the **United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)** estimating that inadequate sanitation costs the global economy ~$260 billion annually. The framework also assesses the **public health outcomes**, including the incidence of waterborne diseases, such as cholera and diarrhea, which affect ~1.6 million people worldwide each year, according to the **Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)**.

The Sanitation Compared framework uses a **multi-criteria decision analysis** approach, weighing the importance of different factors, such as cost, environmental impact, and public health outcomes, to determine the most effective sanitation system for a given context, with **Boeing** using a similar approach to evaluate the environmental impact of its aircraft production, resulting in a ~30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. The framework also considers the **institutional and regulatory context**, including the role of government agencies, such as the **Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)**, in regulating sanitation systems and ensuring compliance with environmental and public health standards.

The Sanitation Compared framework has been applied in **urban planning** contexts, such as the design of sanitation systems for rapidly growing cities, where the **World Bank** estimates that ~70% of the global population will live in urban areas by 2050, placing a significant strain on existing sanitation infrastructure. In these contexts, the framework helps to identify the most effective sanitation solutions, considering factors such as population density, urbanization rates, and existing infrastructure, with the **city of Singapore** using a similar approach to develop its **smart sanitation system**, which includes real-time monitoring of wastewater flows and automated maintenance scheduling.

## Key Components
- **Cost-effectiveness analysis**: This component evaluates the financial viability of different sanitation systems, considering factors such as capital expenditures, operating costs, and maintenance expenses, with the **European Union** estimating that ~$100 billion is spent annually on sanitation infrastructure.
- **Environmental impact assessment**: This component assesses the environmental effects of different sanitation systems, including greenhouse gas emissions, water pollution, and waste generation, with the **Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)** estimating that sanitation systems account for ~10% of global greenhouse gas emissions.
- **Public health risk assessment**: This component evaluates the potential health risks associated with different sanitation systems, including the incidence of waterborne diseases and the impact on human health, with the **World Health Organization (WHO)** estimating that ~9% of global deaths are attributed to inadequate sanitation.
- **Institutional and regulatory context**: This component considers the role of government agencies and regulatory frameworks in ensuring the effective operation and maintenance of sanitation systems, with the **United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)** regulating sanitation systems under the **Clean Water Act**.
- **Technological innovation**: This component evaluates the potential for technological advancements to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of sanitation systems, including the use of **membrane bioreactors** and **advanced oxidation processes**, with **Xylem Inc.** developing innovative wastewater treatment technologies that reduce energy consumption by ~40%.
- **Community engagement and participation**: This component considers the importance of community involvement in the planning, operation, and maintenance of sanitation systems, with the **United Nations** estimating that ~70% of sanitation systems in developing countries are community-managed.

## Common Misconceptions
- **Myth:** Sanitation systems are a luxury that only wealthy countries can afford — **Fact:** The **World Bank** estimates that every dollar invested in sanitation generates a return of ~$5 in economic benefits, making sanitation a sound investment for countries at all income levels.
- **Myth:** Sanitation systems are only relevant in urban areas — **Fact:** The **Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)** estimates that ~70% of the global population lives in rural areas, where sanitation systems are often inadequate or non-existent, highlighting the need for rural sanitation solutions.
- **Myth:** Sanitation systems are solely the responsibility of government agencies — **Fact:** The **private sector** plays a significant role in providing sanitation services, with companies such as **Veolia** and **SUEZ** operating sanitation systems in many countries.
- **Myth:** Sanitation systems are a fixed infrastructure that cannot be changed — **Fact:** The **city of Copenhagen** has implemented a **district heating system** that uses wastewater to generate heat, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by ~70%, demonstrating the potential for innovative sanitation solutions.

## In Practice
The **city of Tokyo** has implemented a comprehensive sanitation system that includes **advanced wastewater treatment technologies**, such as **membrane bioreactors** and **advanced oxidation processes**, which have reduced greenhouse gas emissions by ~50% and improved water quality by ~90%, with the **Tokyo Metropolitan Government** investing ~$10 billion in sanitation infrastructure over the past decade, resulting in a significant reduction in waterborne diseases and improvement in public health outcomes, with the **Tokyo University** estimating that the sanitation system has generated ~$15 billion in economic benefits.
