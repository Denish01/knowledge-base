# What Is Pediatrics?

## Definition
Pediatrics is a branch of medicine that deals with the medical care of infants, children, and adolescents, founded on the principles of **child health** and development, as outlined by Abraham Jacobi, known as the father of pediatrics, in the late 19th century.

## How It Works
Pediatric care involves a range of services, from preventive care, such as vaccinations and screenings, to diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic illnesses, with approximately 80% of pediatric visits in the United States being for preventive care (American Academy of Pediatrics). Pediatricians use frameworks like the **Bright Futures** guidelines to assess child development and provide guidance on healthy growth and development. The **World Health Organization** (WHO) also provides guidelines for pediatric care, including recommendations for infant and child nutrition, with the goal of reducing child mortality rates, which have decreased by 53% since 1990 (WHO).

The pediatric care process typically begins with a thorough medical history and physical examination, followed by diagnostic tests, such as laboratory tests or imaging studies, if necessary. Pediatricians may also use **growth charts** to track a child's growth and development over time, with the **Centers for Disease Control and Prevention** (CDC) providing standardized growth charts for children in the United States. Pediatric care is often provided in outpatient settings, such as pediatrician offices or clinics, but may also involve hospitalization for more serious illnesses or injuries, with the average length of stay for pediatric hospitalizations in the United States being 3.8 days (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality).

## Key Components
- **Preventive care**: Regular check-ups and screenings to prevent and detect health problems early, with the CDC recommending a schedule of well-child visits from birth to age 21.
- **Vaccinations**: Administration of vaccines to protect against infectious diseases, with the CDC recommending a schedule of vaccinations from birth to age 18, including vaccines against diseases like **measles**, **mumps**, and **rubella**.
- **Developmental assessments**: Evaluations of a child's physical, emotional, and cognitive development, using tools like the **Denver Developmental Screening Test**.
- **Nutrition counseling**: Guidance on healthy eating habits and nutrition, with the American Academy of Pediatrics recommending **breastfeeding** as the optimal form of nutrition for infants.
- **Chronic disease management**: Ongoing care and management of chronic conditions, such as **asthma** or **diabetes**, with the goal of controlling symptoms and preventing complications.
- **Mental health services**: Assessment and treatment of mental health issues, such as **anxiety** or **depression**, with the American Academy of Pediatrics recommending regular mental health screenings for children and adolescents.

## Common Misconceptions
**Myth:** All pediatricians are trained to provide mental health services — **Fact:** While pediatricians are trained to provide basic mental health services, they may refer children to **child psychiatrists** or other mental health specialists for more complex issues (American Academy of Pediatrics).
**Myth:** Vaccines are only necessary for young children — **Fact:** Vaccines are recommended for children and adolescents of all ages, with the CDC recommending a schedule of vaccinations from birth to age 18, including booster shots and vaccines against diseases like **meningitis**.
**Myth:** Pediatric care is only provided in hospitals — **Fact:** Most pediatric care is provided in outpatient settings, such as pediatrician offices or clinics, with approximately 90% of pediatric visits in the United States taking place in outpatient settings (CDC).
**Myth:** All children develop at the same rate — **Fact:** Children develop at different rates, with some children needing more time to reach certain milestones, and pediatricians use **growth charts** to track a child's growth and development over time (CDC).

## In Practice
In the United States, pediatric care is often provided by pediatricians in private practice or in hospital-based clinics, with approximately 45,000 pediatricians in practice (American Academy of Pediatrics). For example, **Children's Hospital Los Angeles** provides comprehensive pediatric care, including preventive care, diagnosis and treatment of illnesses, and management of chronic conditions, with a team of over 500 pediatricians and other healthcare professionals. The hospital also has a **pediatric intensive care unit** with 24 beds, which provides critical care to children with serious illnesses or injuries, with a mortality rate of 2.5% (Children's Hospital Los Angeles).
