  "content": "There are four main categories of pediatrics, organized by the age and developmental stage of the patients, as well as the specific medical needs and specialties required. \n## Main Categories\n- **Neonatology** \u2014 the branch of pediatrics that deals with the medical care of newborn babies, particularly those who are premature, critically ill, or in need of surgery, with a notable example being the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at Children's Hospital Los Angeles.\n- **Pediatric cardiology** \u2014 a specialty that focuses on the diagnosis, treatment, and management of heart defects and other cardiovascular disorders in children, such as the pediatric cardiology program at Boston Children's Hospital, which performs over 1,000 cardiac surgeries annually (Boston Children's Hospital annual report).\n- **Adolescent medicine** \u2014 a field of pediatrics that addresses the unique physical, emotional, and social needs of teenagers, including issues related to puberty, mental health, and substance abuse, with a prominent example being the Adolescent Medicine Program at Seattle Children's Hospital.\n- **Developmental pediatrics** \u2014 a specialty that focuses on the diagnosis, treatment, and management of developmental and behavioral disorders in children, such as autism, ADHD, and learning disabilities, with a notable example being the Developmental Pediatrics Program at the University of California, San Francisco, which provides comprehensive assessments and interventions for children with complex developmental needs.\n\n## Comparison Table\n| Category | Age Range | Specialized Training | Multidisciplinary Approach |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Neonatology | 0-1 month | Fellowship in neonatology | High, requiring collaboration with obstetricians, surgeons, and other specialists |\n| Pediatric cardiology | 0-18 years | Fellowship in pediatric cardiology | High, involving cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, and other medical professionals |\n| Adolescent medicine | 11-21 years | Fellowship in adolescent medicine | Moderate, often involving psychologists, social workers, and other healthcare providers |\n| Developmental pediatrics | 0-18 years | Fellowship in developmental pediatrics | High, requiring collaboration with psychologists, therapists, and other specialists |\n\n## How They Relate\nThe categories of pediatrics often overlap, with patients requiring care from multiple specialties. For example, a newborn with a heart defect may require care from both a **neonatologist** and a **pediatric cardiologist**. Similarly, an adolescent with a developmental disorder may need care from both an **adolescent medicine specialist** and a **developmental pediatrician**. The **pediatric cardiology** and **developmental pediatrics** categories may also intersect, as children with heart defects may be at higher risk for developmental delays or disorders. Additionally, **neonatology** and **developmental pediatrics** may be connected, as premature or critically ill newborns may be at higher risk for developmental problems later in life.",
