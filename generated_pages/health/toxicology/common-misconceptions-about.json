  "content": "The most common misconception about toxicology is that a substance is toxic only if it is immediately lethal, a myth that has been debunked by Paracelsus' principle that \"the dose makes the poison\" (Paracelsus, 1538).\n\n## Misconceptions\n- **Myth:** Toxic substances are always synthetic and man-made.\n- **Fact:** Many toxic substances are naturally occurring, such as botulinum toxin, which is produced by the bacteria Clostridium botulinum and is one of the most toxic substances known, with an LD50 of 1 ng/kg (CDC).\n- **Source of confusion:** This myth persists due to the media narrative that often focuses on the dangers of synthetic chemicals, while overlooking the toxicity of natural substances.\n- **Myth:** The toxicity of a substance is directly correlated with its carcinogenicity.\n- **Fact:** While some toxic substances are carcinogenic, such as benzo[a]pyrene, which has a carcinogenic potency of 0.027 (mg/kg/day)^-1 (EPA), others are not, and vice versa, as shown by the example of ethanol, which is toxic but not carcinogenic at low doses (IARC).\n- **Source of confusion:** This myth is perpetuated by the misconception that all toxic substances cause cancer, a fallacy that ignores the complex relationships between toxicity, carcinogenicity, and other health effects.\n- **Myth:** Toxicity is always dose-dependent.\n- **Fact:** Some substances, such as certain allergens, can cause severe reactions at very low doses, regardless of the dose, as seen in the case of peanut allergies, which can be fatal even at doses as low as 1-2 mg (FAO).\n- **Source of confusion:** This myth stems from the oversimplification of Paracelsus' principle, which is often misunderstood to mean that all toxic effects are directly proportional to the dose.\n- **Myth:** Children are more resistant to toxic substances than adults.\n- **Fact:** Children are often more vulnerable to toxic substances due to their smaller body size and developing organs, as shown by the example of lead poisoning, which can cause permanent neurological damage in children at doses as low as 10 \u03bcg/dL (CDC).\n- **Source of confusion:** This myth is perpetuated by the misconception that children are more resilient to toxins, a fallacy that ignores the complex interactions between developmental biology and toxicology.\n- **Myth:** Toxic substances are always immediately harmful.\n- **Fact:** Some toxic substances, such as asbestos, can cause harm after a long latency period, often decades after exposure, as seen in the case of mesothelioma, a cancer caused by asbestos exposure that can take 20-50 years to develop (NIH).\n- **Source of confusion:** This myth is perpetuated by the misconception that all toxic effects are immediate and overt, a fallacy that ignores the complex relationships between exposure, dose, and latency.\n- **Myth:** The toxicity of a substance is always the same across different species.\n- **Fact:** Toxicity can vary significantly between species, as shown by the example of thalidomide, which is teratogenic in humans but not in rats (FDA).\n- **Source of confusion:** This myth stems from the oversimplification of toxicological principles, which are often assumed to be universal across species.\n\n## Quick Reference\n- Myth: Toxic substances are always synthetic \u2192 Fact: Many toxic substances are naturally occurring, such as botulinum toxin (CDC).\n- Myth: Toxicity is directly correlated with carcinogenicity \u2192 Fact: Some toxic substances are not carcinogenic, and vice versa, as shown by the example of ethanol (IARC).\n- Myth: Toxicity is always dose-dependent \u2192 Fact: Some substances, such as certain allergens, can cause severe reactions at very low doses (FAO).\n- Myth: Children are more resistant to toxic substances \u2192 Fact: Children are often more vulnerable to toxic substances due to their smaller body size and developing organs (CDC).\n- Myth: Toxic substances are always immediately harmful \u2192 Fact: Some toxic substances, such as asbestos, can cause harm after a long latency period (NIH).\n- Myth: Toxicity is always the same across different species \u2192 Fact: Toxicity can vary significantly between species, as shown by the example of thalidomide (FDA).\n- Myth: A substance is toxic only if it is immediately lethal \u2192 Fact: Toxicity can occur at sublethal doses, as shown by Paracelsus' principle that \"the dose makes the poison\" (Paracelsus, 1538).",
