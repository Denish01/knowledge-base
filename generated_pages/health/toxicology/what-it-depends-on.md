# What Toxicology Depends On

Chemistry is the most critical dependency for toxicology, as understanding the chemical properties and reactions of substances is necessary to assess their potential harm to living organisms.

## Key Dependencies
- **Chemistry** — a strong foundation in chemistry is required to understand the chemical properties and reactions of toxic substances, and without it, toxicologists cannot accurately assess the risks associated with exposure to these substances. The absence of a strong chemistry foundation was evident in the case of thalidomide, where the drug's chemical properties were not fully understood, leading to its tragic use as a teratogen in the 1950s and 1960s.
- **Biology** — a thorough understanding of biological systems is necessary to comprehend how toxic substances interact with living organisms, and without it, toxicologists cannot predict the potential harm caused by these substances. The lack of understanding of biological systems was a contributing factor in the Minamata disease outbreak in Japan, where the release of methylmercury into the environment had devastating effects on the local population.
- **Pharmacology** — knowledge of pharmacology is essential to understand how toxic substances are absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and eliminated by the body, and without it, toxicologists cannot develop effective treatments for poisoning. The importance of pharmacology was highlighted in the case of paracetamol poisoning, where an understanding of the drug's pharmacokinetics was crucial in developing effective antidotes.
- **Epidemiology** — epidemiology provides the framework for studying the relationships between toxic substances and disease in human populations, and without it, toxicologists cannot identify the risks associated with exposure to these substances. The absence of epidemiological studies was a major factor in the delay in recognizing the health risks associated with asbestos exposure.
- **Regulatory frameworks** — regulatory frameworks, such as those provided by the **Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)**, are necessary to establish guidelines and standards for the safe handling and use of toxic substances, and without them, workers and the general public are at risk of exposure to these substances. The lack of effective regulatory frameworks was evident in the case of the Bhopal disaster, where the release of toxic gases from a pesticide plant had devastating consequences.

## Priority Order
The dependencies can be ranked in order of priority as follows:
1. **Chemistry** — this is the most critical dependency, as a strong foundation in chemistry is necessary to understand the chemical properties and reactions of toxic substances.
2. **Biology** — a thorough understanding of biological systems is necessary to comprehend how toxic substances interact with living organisms.
3. **Pharmacology** — knowledge of pharmacology is essential to understand how toxic substances are absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and eliminated by the body.
4. **Epidemiology** — epidemiology provides the framework for studying the relationships between toxic substances and disease in human populations.
5. **Regulatory frameworks** — while regulatory frameworks are necessary to establish guidelines and standards for the safe handling and use of toxic substances, they are less critical than the scientific dependencies.

## Common Gaps
One common assumption that people take for granted is that toxic substances will always have immediate and obvious effects, when in fact many toxic substances can have delayed or subtle effects that are only apparent after long-term exposure. This assumption can lead to a failure to recognize the risks associated with exposure to these substances, as was the case with the use of Agent Orange during the Vietnam War, where the long-term effects of exposure to the herbicide were not fully appreciated until many years later.
