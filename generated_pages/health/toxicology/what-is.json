Orfila's work laid the foundation for the field, which has since expanded to include the study of the mechanisms of toxicity, the detection and measurement of toxic substances, and the development of methods for preventing and treating poisonings.\n\n## How It Works\nThe process of toxicology involves the interaction of a toxic substance with a living organism, resulting in a harmful effect. This interaction can occur through various routes of exposure, including ingestion, inhalation, and skin contact. The **dose-response relationship** is a fundamental concept in toxicology, where the severity of the toxic effect is directly proportional to the dose of the toxic substance. For example, the lethal dose of **cyanide** is approximately 1.4 milligrams per kilogram of body weight (American Association of Poison Control Centers).\n\nToxic substances can affect living organisms through various mechanisms, including **enzyme inhibition**, **receptor binding**, and **DNA damage**. The **LD50**, or median lethal dose, is a measure of the toxicity of a substance, where 50% of the test subjects die after exposure to the substance. The LD50 of **sodium cyanide** is approximately 3.7 milligrams per kilogram of body weight (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health). The **no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL)** is another important concept in toxicology, which represents the highest dose of a substance that does not produce any adverse effects.\n\nToxicology also involves the study of **biotransformation**, where the body converts toxic substances into less toxic metabolites. This process can occur through various pathways, including **oxidation**, **reduction**, and **hydrolysis**. The **Cytochrome P450 enzyme system** is a key player in biotransformation, responsible for the metabolism of many toxic substances (Guengerich, 2008).\n\n## Key Components\n- **Toxicokinetics**: the study of the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of toxic substances, which helps to understand how the body processes and eliminates toxic chemicals.\n- **Toxicodynamics**: the study of the mechanisms of toxicity, including the interaction of toxic substances with biological molecules and the resulting harmful effects.\n- **Dose-response assessment**: the process of estimating the relationship between the dose of a toxic substance and the resulting toxic effect, which is critical for setting safe exposure limits.\n- **Exposure assessment**: the process of estimating the amount and duration of exposure to a toxic substance, which is essential for determining the risk of adverse effects.\n- **Risk characterization**: the process of evaluating the potential health risks associated with exposure to a toxic substance, which involves integrating the results of dose-response assessment and exposure assessment.\n- **Biomarkers**: measurable indicators of exposure to toxic substances, such as **acetylcholinesterase activity** in the case of **organophosphate poisoning** (World Health Organization).\n\n## Common Misconceptions\n**Myth:** Toxicology is only concerned with the study of poisons. **Fact:** Toxicology is a broad field that encompasses the study of all adverse effects of chemicals on living organisms, including **carcinogenesis** and **mutagenesis**. \n**Myth:** The **LD50** is a direct measure of the toxicity of a substance. **Fact:** The LD50 is only one measure of toxicity, and it does not take into account other important factors, such as the **NOAEL** and the **maximum tolerated dose (MTD)**. \n**Myth:** Toxicology is a new field of study. **Fact:** Toxicology has a long history, dating back to the work of **Matthew Orfila** in the early 19th century.\n**Myth:** Toxicology is only relevant to human health. **Fact:** Toxicology is also relevant to **environmental health**, as toxic substances can have harmful effects on **ecosystems** and **wildlife** (United States Environmental Protection Agency).\n\n## In Practice\nThe **US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)** uses toxicology to set safe exposure limits for **pesticides** and **industrial chemicals**. For example, the EPA has set a **reference dose (RfD)** of 0.005 milligrams per kilogram of body weight per day for **chlorpyrifos**, a commonly used pesticide (US EPA). The **Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)** also uses toxicology to set **permissible exposure limits (PELs)** for **hazardous chemicals** in the workplace. In the case of **benzene**, a known **carcinogen**, OSHA has set a PEL of 1 part per million (ppm) (OSHA).",
