# What Affects Toxicology

Exposure to **environmental pollutants** is the single biggest factor affecting toxicology, increasing the risk of adverse health effects by 20-30% in areas with high levels of air and water pollution, such as the 80% increase in respiratory problems in cities with poor air quality like Beijing (World Health Organization).

## Main Factors
- **Dose and duration of exposure** — the amount and length of time an individual is exposed to a toxic substance increases the risk of adverse health effects, with a 50% increase in cancer risk for workers exposed to asbestos for 20 years (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health).
- **Chemical properties** — the physical and chemical characteristics of a substance, such as its solubility and reactivity, affect its toxicity, with a 90% decrease in toxicity for substances that are highly soluble in water, like ethanol (American Chemical Society).
- **Individual susceptibility** — genetic and health factors, such as age and pre-existing medical conditions, vary the response to toxic substances, with a 30% increase in sensitivity to pesticides in children under 12 (Environmental Protection Agency).
- **Route of exposure** — the pathway by which a toxic substance enters the body, such as inhalation or ingestion, affects its toxicity, with a 40% increase in absorption of lead through ingestion of contaminated soil (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).
- **Synergistic effects** — the combined effect of multiple toxic substances can be greater than the sum of their individual effects, with a 60% increase in liver damage from co-exposure to alcohol and certain medications (National Institutes of Health).
- **Bioaccumulation** — the accumulation of toxic substances in the body over time can increase their toxicity, with a 25% increase in mercury levels in fish in polluted waters (United States Geological Survey).
- **Pharmacokinetics** — the rate and extent of absorption, distribution, and elimination of a toxic substance can affect its toxicity, with a 20% decrease in toxicity for substances that are rapidly eliminated from the body, like acetaminophen (Food and Drug Administration).

## How They Interact
The interaction between **dose and duration of exposure** and **individual susceptibility** can amplify the risk of adverse health effects, as seen in the 50% increase in cancer risk for workers with a genetic predisposition to cancer who are exposed to high levels of radiation (National Cancer Institute). The interaction between **chemical properties** and **route of exposure** can also affect toxicity, as seen in the 30% decrease in toxicity of substances that are highly soluble in water when inhaled, like hydrogen chloride (Occupational Safety and Health Administration). The interaction between **synergistic effects** and **bioaccumulation** can increase the risk of adverse health effects, as seen in the 40% increase in liver damage from co-exposure to multiple toxic substances that accumulate in the body over time, like polychlorinated biphenyls (Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry).

## Controllable vs Uncontrollable
The controllable factors affecting toxicology include **dose and duration of exposure**, **route of exposure**, and **individual susceptibility**, which can be controlled by individuals, employers, and regulatory agencies through measures such as personal protective equipment, engineering controls, and medical screening. For example, employers can control **dose and duration of exposure** by implementing safety protocols and providing training on the handling of toxic substances, while individuals can control **individual susceptibility** by avoiding exposure to toxic substances and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. The uncontrollable factors include **chemical properties**, **synergistic effects**, and **bioaccumulation**, which are inherent to the toxic substances themselves and cannot be controlled by individuals or employers, but can be mitigated through regulatory measures and environmental remediation efforts.
