# Toxicology Compared

## Definition
Toxicology Compared is a field of study that refers to the comparative analysis of the adverse effects of chemicals on living organisms, originating from the work of **Paracelsus** in the 16th century.

## How It Works
Toxicology Compared involves the use of **dose-response relationships** to understand the effects of different chemicals on living organisms. This relationship is characterized by the **No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL)**, which is the highest dose of a chemical that does not produce any adverse effects, and the **Lowest Observed Adverse Effect Level (LOAEL)**, which is the lowest dose that produces an adverse effect. For example, the **Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)** uses these relationships to set **maximum contaminant levels** for chemicals in drinking water, such as the 0.015 milligrams per liter limit for **arsenic**.

The comparative analysis of toxicology data is often performed using **benchmark dose (BMD) modeling**, which estimates the dose of a chemical that produces a specific adverse effect. This approach is used by regulatory agencies, such as the **National Toxicology Program (NTP)**, to evaluate the toxicity of chemicals and establish **safe exposure limits**. The NTP has used BMD modeling to evaluate the toxicity of chemicals such as **bisphenol A (BPA)**, which is used in the production of **polycarbonate plastics** and has been shown to produce adverse effects on the **reproductive system** at doses as low as 0.05 milligrams per kilogram per day.

Toxicology Compared also involves the use of **in vitro** and **in vivo** testing methods to evaluate the toxicity of chemicals. **In vitro** testing involves the use of cell cultures or other laboratory-based methods to evaluate the toxicity of chemicals, while **in vivo** testing involves the use of living organisms, such as **rats** or **mice**. The **Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)** has established guidelines for the use of these testing methods, which are used by regulatory agencies to evaluate the toxicity of chemicals and establish **safe exposure limits**. For example, the OECD has established guidelines for the use of **in vitro** testing methods to evaluate the toxicity of chemicals such as **dioxins**, which are known to produce adverse effects on the **immune system**.

## Key Components
- **Dose-response relationships**: describe the relationship between the dose of a chemical and the resulting adverse effects, and are used to establish **safe exposure limits**.
- **NOAEL and LOAEL**: are used to characterize the dose-response relationship and establish **maximum contaminant levels** for chemicals in drinking water.
- **Benchmark dose (BMD) modeling**: is used to estimate the dose of a chemical that produces a specific adverse effect and is used by regulatory agencies to evaluate the toxicity of chemicals.
- **In vitro and in vivo testing methods**: are used to evaluate the toxicity of chemicals and establish **safe exposure limits**.
- **Toxicity endpoints**: such as **LD50** (the dose of a chemical that is lethal to 50% of the test population) and **EC50** (the dose of a chemical that produces a specific adverse effect in 50% of the test population), are used to characterize the toxicity of chemicals.
- **Exposure assessment**: is used to evaluate the potential for human exposure to chemicals and establish **safe exposure limits**.

## Common Misconceptions
**Myth:** Toxicology Compared is only concerned with the toxicity of chemicals in the environment. **Fact:** Toxicology Compared is also concerned with the toxicity of chemicals in the workplace and in consumer products, such as **cosmetics** and **pharmaceuticals**.
**Myth:** The **NOAEL** is the only dose-response parameter used in Toxicology Compared. **Fact:** The **LOAEL** and **BMD** are also used to characterize the dose-response relationship and establish **safe exposure limits**.
**Myth:** **In vitro** testing methods are not useful for evaluating the toxicity of chemicals. **Fact:** **In vitro** testing methods, such as the **Ames test**, are widely used to evaluate the toxicity of chemicals and have been shown to be effective in identifying **mutagens** and **carcinogens**.
**Myth:** Toxicology Compared is a new field of study. **Fact:** Toxicology Compared has its roots in the work of **Paracelsus** in the 16th century and has been developed over the centuries through the work of **scientists** such as **Louis Pasteur** and **Rachel Carson**.

## In Practice
The city of **Flint, Michigan** experienced a **water crisis** in 2014, when it was discovered that the city's water supply was contaminated with **lead**. The **EPA** used Toxicology Compared to evaluate the toxicity of the contaminated water and establish **safe exposure limits**. The agency used **BMD modeling** to estimate the dose of **lead** that would produce adverse effects on the **nervous system** and established a **maximum contaminant level** of 0.015 milligrams per liter. The city of Flint has since taken steps to remediate the contaminated water supply and provide **safe drinking water** to its residents. The **Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)** has also used Toxicology Compared to evaluate the toxicity of **lead** in the **blood** of children and has established a **reference level** of 5 micrograms per deciliter.
