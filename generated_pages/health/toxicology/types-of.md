# Types of Toxicology

There are four main categories of toxicology, organized by the source and nature of the toxic substances: **Environmental Toxicology**, **Occupational Toxicology**, **Pharmacological Toxicology**, and **Forensic Toxicology**.

## Main Categories
- **Environmental Toxicology** — the study of toxic substances in the environment, including air, water, and soil pollution, with distinguishing characteristics such as exposure to pollutants through inhalation, ingestion, or skin contact, and a concrete example being the **Love Canal disaster**, where toxic waste dumping led to severe health problems for local residents.
- **Occupational Toxicology** — the study of toxic substances in the workplace, including exposure to chemicals, heavy metals, and other hazardous materials, with distinguishing characteristics such as prolonged exposure to low levels of toxins and a concrete example being the **asbestos industry**, where workers were exposed to carcinogenic fibers.
- **Pharmacological Toxicology** — the study of toxic substances in relation to pharmaceuticals, including adverse drug reactions and overdose, with distinguishing characteristics such as dose-dependent toxicity and a concrete example being **acetaminophen overdose**, which can cause liver damage.
- **Forensic Toxicology** — the application of toxicology to aid in the investigation of crimes, including the analysis of blood, tissue, and other biological samples, with distinguishing characteristics such as the use of toxicology results as evidence in court and a concrete example being the **O.J. Simpson trial**, where toxicology results were used to analyze blood samples.

## Comparison Table
| Category | Source of Toxins | Exposure Route | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Environmental Toxicology | Industrial waste, pollution | Inhalation, ingestion, skin contact | Love Canal disaster |
| Occupational Toxicology | Workplace chemicals, heavy metals | Inhalation, skin contact | Asbestos industry |
| Pharmacological Toxicology | Pharmaceuticals | Ingestion, injection | Acetaminophen overdose |
| Forensic Toxicology | Illicit substances, poisons | Ingestion, injection, inhalation | O.J. Simpson trial |

## How They Relate
The categories of toxicology often overlap, with environmental toxicology and occupational toxicology both involving exposure to pollutants, and pharmacological toxicology and forensic toxicology both involving the analysis of biological samples. For example, **occupational toxicology** and **environmental toxicology** can be related in cases where workplace pollutants are released into the environment, such as in the **Bhopal disaster**, where a gas leak at a chemical plant exposed both workers and local residents to toxic substances. Similarly, **pharmacological toxicology** and **forensic toxicology** can be related in cases where pharmaceuticals are used as evidence in criminal investigations, such as in **drug-facilitated sexual assault** cases, where toxicology results are used to analyze blood samples for the presence of date-rape drugs.
