  "content": "There are over 100 types of arthritis, which can be broadly categorized into seven main groups based on their underlying causes and mechanisms. \n## Main Categories\n- **Osteoarthritis** \u2014 a degenerative joint disease characterized by cartilage breakdown, joint pain, and stiffness, as seen in **Knee Osteoarthritis**, which affects the knee joint of former NFL player Joe Montana.\n- **Rheumatoid Arthritis** \u2014 an autoimmune disease that causes inflammation and pain in the joints, distinguished by its symmetrical pattern of joint involvement, as exemplified by **Seropositive Rheumatoid Arthritis**, which affects actress Kathleen Turner.\n- **Psoriatic Arthritis** \u2014 a type of arthritis that occurs in people with psoriasis, marked by joint pain, stiffness, and swelling, accompanied by skin and nail changes, as seen in **Psoriatic Spondylitis**, which affects musician Art Garfunkel.\n- **Gout** \u2014 a type of arthritis caused by the buildup of uric acid crystals in the joints, characterized by sudden, severe attacks of pain, redness, and swelling, as exemplified by **Tophaceous Gout**, which affects former US President Grover Cleveland.\n- **Lupus** \u2014 a chronic autoimmune disease that can cause arthritis, as well as inflammation in other parts of the body, such as the skin, kidneys, and brain, as seen in **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus**, which affects actress Selena Gomez.\n- **Ankylosing Spondylitis** \u2014 a type of arthritis that primarily affects the spine, causing inflammation and stiffness in the vertebrae, as exemplified by **Radiographic Axial Spondyloarthritis**, which affects musician Mick Mars.\n- **Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis** \u2014 a type of arthritis that occurs in children and adolescents, characterized by persistent joint pain, stiffness, and swelling, as seen in **Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis**, which affects child actress Chloe Perrin.\n\n## Comparison Table\n| Type of Arthritis | Joint Involvement | Inflammatory Response | Treatment Options |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Osteoarthritis | Asymmetrical, weight-bearing joints | Low-grade inflammation | Pain management, physical therapy, joint replacement surgery (e.g., Knee Osteoarthritis, which may require knee replacement surgery) |\n| Rheumatoid Arthritis | Symmetrical, small and large joints | High-grade inflammation | Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), biologics, corticosteroids (e.g., Seropositive Rheumatoid Arthritis, which may require a combination of DMARDs and biologics) |\n| Psoriatic Arthritis | Asymmetrical, small and large joints | High-grade inflammation | DMARDs, biologics, topical corticosteroids (e.g., Psoriatic Spondylitis, which may require a combination of DMARDs and biologics) |\n| Gout | Acute, monoarticular | High-grade inflammation | Colchicine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), uric acid-lowering therapy (e.g., Tophaceous Gout, which may require uric acid-lowering therapy) |\n| Lupus | Variable, small and large joints | High-grade inflammation | Corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, antimalarial drugs (e.g., Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, which may require a combination of corticosteroids and immunosuppressants) |\n| Ankylosing Spondylitis | Chronic, axial skeleton | High-grade inflammation | DMARDs, biologics, physical therapy (e.g., Radiographic Axial Spondyloarthritis, which may require a combination of DMARDs and biologics) |\n| Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis | Variable, small and large joints | High-grade inflammation | DMARDs, biologics, corticosteroids (e.g., Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis, which may require a combination of DMARDs and biologics) |\n\n## How They Relate\nThe different types of arthritis can overlap, with some individuals experiencing symptoms of multiple conditions. For example, **Psoriatic Arthritis** and **Rheumatoid Arthritis** can both cause joint pain and inflammation, but they have distinct underlying mechanisms and require different treatment approaches. **Ankylosing Spondylitis** and **Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis** can both affect the spine, but they have different age ranges and symptom profiles. Additionally, **Lupus** can cause arthritis, as well as other systemic symptoms, and may be confused with **Rheumatoid Arthritis** due to their similar joint involvement patterns. **Gout** can be distinguished from other types of arthritis by its sudden, severe attacks of pain and its association with uric acid buildup. **Osteoarthritis** can be differentiated from other types of arthritis by its degenerative joint changes and lack of systemic inflammation. Specific pairs of arthritis types that are commonly confused include **Psoriatic Arthritis** and **Rheumatoid Arthritis**, **Ankylosing Spondylitis** and **Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis**, and **Lupus** and **Rheumatoid Arthritis**.",
