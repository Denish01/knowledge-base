# How Arthritis Works

Arthritis is a complex mechanism involving the breakdown of **cartilage** and **joint inflammation**, triggered by an interplay of genetic, environmental, and hormonal factors that ultimately lead to joint pain and stiffness.

## The Mechanism
The core cause-and-effect chain in arthritis involves the degradation of **cartilage** by enzymes such as **matrix metalloproteinases**, leading to the release of pro-inflammatory **cytokines** like **tumor necrosis factor-alpha** (TNF-alpha) and **interleukin-1 beta** (IL-1beta), which in turn stimulate the production of inflammatory mediators. This process results in the infiltration of immune cells into the joint, causing inflammation and further cartilage degradation.

## Step-by-Step
1. The breakdown of **cartilage** begins with the activation of **chondrocytes**, which produce **matrix metalloproteinases** that degrade the cartilage matrix, releasing approximately 30-40% of the cartilage's **glycosaminoglycan** content.
2. The degradation of **cartilage** leads to the release of **pro-inflammatory cytokines** such as TNF-alpha and IL-1beta, which stimulate the production of inflammatory mediators, resulting in a 2-3 fold increase in **prostaglandin E2** (PGE2) production.
3. The increased production of PGE2 leads to the activation of **osteoclasts**, which resorb bone, resulting in a 10-20% decrease in **bone density** over a period of 6-12 months.
4. The activation of **osteoclasts** also leads to the formation of **bone spurs**, which can increase the risk of joint **subluxation** by 15-25%.
5. The infiltration of immune cells into the joint causes inflammation, leading to a 50-70% increase in **synovial fluid** production, which can result in joint **effusion**.
6. The chronic inflammation and joint damage lead to the development of **fibrosis**, resulting in a 20-30% decrease in **joint range of motion** over a period of 1-2 years.

## Key Components
- **Cartilage**: provides cushioning and support to the joint, and its degradation leads to joint pain and stiffness.
- **Chondrocytes**: produce **matrix metalloproteinases** that degrade the cartilage matrix.
- **Cytokines**: such as TNF-alpha and IL-1beta, stimulate the production of inflammatory mediators.
- **Osteoclasts**: resorb bone, leading to a decrease in **bone density**.
- **Synovial fluid**: helps to lubricate the joint, but excessive production can lead to joint **effusion**.

## Common Questions
What happens if the **cartilage** is completely degraded? The complete degradation of **cartilage** can lead to **bone-on-bone** contact, resulting in severe joint pain and stiffness, and potentially requiring **joint replacement** surgery.
What is the role of **genetics** in arthritis? **Genetics** can play a significant role in the development of arthritis, with certain genetic mutations increasing the risk of developing **rheumatoid arthritis** by 2-3 fold.
How does **obesity** affect arthritis? **Obesity** can increase the risk of developing **osteoarthritis** by 10-20%, due to the increased mechanical stress on the joints.
What is the effect of **age** on arthritis? **Age** can increase the risk of developing **osteoarthritis**, with the risk increasing by 10-20% per decade after the age of 40.
