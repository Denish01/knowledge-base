# What Affects Arthritis

Obesity is the single biggest factor affecting arthritis, as excess body weight increases the mechanical stress on joints, particularly in the hips, knees, and ankles, by approximately 10% for every 10 pounds of weight gain, with a study by Felson et al. finding that a 10% weight loss can reduce the risk of osteoarthritis by 50% in women.

## Main Factors
- **Genetics** — genetic predisposition increases the risk of developing arthritis, with certain genetic mutations altering the production of cartilage and joint proteins, increasing the risk by 2-3 times, as seen in families with a history of arthritis, where 30% of individuals may develop the condition.
- **Obesity** — excess body weight increases the mechanical stress on joints, leading to an increased risk of osteoarthritis, with each 10 pounds of weight gain increasing the risk by 10%, as evidenced by the 25% increased risk of osteoarthritis in individuals with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher.
- **Age** — the risk of developing osteoarthritis increases with age, with 30% of people over 65 years old developing the condition, due to the natural wear and tear of joints over time, with a 50% increase in osteoarthritis risk for every decade after 40 years of age.
- **Injury** — joint injuries, such as fractures or ligament sprains, can increase the risk of developing osteoarthritis, with a 2-3 times increased risk after a severe joint injury, as seen in athletes who have suffered joint injuries, where 50% may develop osteoarthritis later in life.
- **Infection** — certain infections, such as Lyme disease or tuberculosis, can increase the risk of developing septic arthritis, with a 10% increased risk of septic arthritis in individuals with a history of Lyme disease.
- **Hormonal changes** — hormonal fluctuations during menopause or pregnancy can increase the risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis, with a 2-3 times increased risk in postmenopausal women, as seen in studies by the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases.
- **Occupational factors** — repetitive joint movements or heavy lifting can increase the risk of developing osteoarthritis, with a 2-3 times increased risk in individuals who work in jobs that require heavy lifting or repetitive movements, such as construction workers or miners.

## How They Interact
The interaction between **obesity** and **age** can amplify the risk of developing osteoarthritis, as the mechanical stress on joints increases with age and excess body weight, with a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention finding that 60% of adults over 65 years old with a BMI of 30 or higher have osteoarthritis. The interaction between **injury** and **genetics** can also increase the risk of developing osteoarthritis, as individuals with a genetic predisposition to arthritis may be more susceptible to joint damage after an injury, with a study by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons finding that 75% of individuals with a family history of arthritis develop osteoarthritis after a joint injury. The interaction between **hormonal changes** and **infection** can also increase the risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis, as hormonal fluctuations can increase the risk of infection, which can trigger an autoimmune response and increase the risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis.

## Controllable vs Uncontrollable
The controllable factors include **obesity**, **injury**, **occupational factors**, and **hormonal changes**, which can be controlled through lifestyle changes, such as maintaining a healthy weight, avoiding joint injuries, and managing stress, with individuals having control over their diet and exercise habits, and employers having control over workplace safety and ergonomics. The uncontrollable factors include **genetics**, **age**, and **infection**, which are determined by genetic predisposition, natural aging, and exposure to infectious agents, with individuals having limited control over these factors, although preventive measures such as vaccinations and antibiotics can reduce the risk of infection.
