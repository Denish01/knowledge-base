  "content": "Arthritis is often misunderstood as a single disease that only affects the elderly, but **osteoarthritis** and **rheumatoid arthritis** are two distinct conditions that can affect people of all ages. \n## Misconceptions\n- **Myth:** Arthritis only affects older adults.\n- **Fact:** Approximately 300,000 children in the United States have been diagnosed with **juvenile idiopathic arthritis** (American College of Rheumatology), and people under 40 can also develop **rheumatoid arthritis**, as seen in the case of Camilo Castaldi, who was diagnosed at age 22.\n- **Source of confusion:** The misconception persists due to media narratives often portraying arthritis as an age-related disease, such as in the Merck Manual of Geriatrics.\n- **Myth:** Cracking joints will lead to arthritis.\n- **Fact:** Research by the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases has found no correlation between joint cracking and the development of **osteoarthritis**.\n- **Source of confusion:** This myth may have originated from the fact that people with arthritis often experience joint cracking, leading to a false cause-and-effect assumption.\n- **Myth:** Arthritis is always debilitating.\n- **Fact:** With proper treatment, many people with arthritis can lead active lives, such as Tennis player Billie Jean King, who has **rheumatoid arthritis** but continues to play tennis (Arthritis Foundation).\n- **Source of confusion:** The misconception may stem from outdated textbooks, such as the 2002 edition of the Oxford Textbook of Rheumatology, which emphasized the limitations imposed by arthritis.\n- **Myth:** Exercise will worsen arthritis symptoms.\n- **Fact:** Low-impact exercise, such as swimming or cycling, can actually reduce arthritis symptoms and improve joint function, as shown in a study by the Arthritis Foundation.\n- **Source of confusion:** This myth may have originated from the fact that high-impact exercise can exacerbate arthritis symptoms, leading to a blanket assumption about all physical activity.\n- **Myth:** Arthritis is caused by a poor diet.\n- **Fact:** While diet can affect arthritis symptoms, there is no evidence to suggest that a specific diet can cause arthritis, according to the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases.\n- **Source of confusion:** The misconception may have arisen from the fact that certain foods can trigger arthritis flare-ups, leading to a false assumption about the role of diet in causing the disease.\n- **Myth:** All arthritis is the same.\n- **Fact:** There are over 100 types of arthritis, including **psoriatic arthritis**, **gout**, and **fibromyalgia**, each with distinct symptoms and treatments, as outlined in the Arthritis Foundation's disease dictionary.\n- **Source of confusion:** The misconception may have originated from the fact that **osteoarthritis** is the most common type of arthritis, leading to a lack of awareness about other forms of the disease.\n\n## Quick Reference\n- Myth: Arthritis only affects older adults \u2192 Fact: 300,000 children in the US have **juvenile idiopathic arthritis** (American College of Rheumatology)\n- Myth: Cracking joints will lead to arthritis \u2192 Fact: No correlation between joint cracking and **osteoarthritis** (National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases)\n- Myth: Arthritis is always debilitating \u2192 Fact: Proper treatment can enable active lives, such as Tennis player Billie Jean King (Arthritis Foundation)\n- Myth: Exercise will worsen arthritis symptoms \u2192 Fact: Low-impact exercise can reduce symptoms and improve joint function (Arthritis Foundation)\n- Myth: Arthritis is caused by a poor diet \u2192 Fact: No evidence to suggest that diet can cause arthritis (National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases)\n- Myth: All arthritis is the same \u2192 Fact: Over 100 types of arthritis, including **psoriatic arthritis**, **gout**, and **fibromyalgia** (Arthritis Foundation)",
