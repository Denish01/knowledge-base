# What Arthritis Depends On

Genetic predisposition is the most critical dependency for arthritis, as it determines an individual's susceptibility to the disease. 
## Key Dependencies
- **Genetic Predisposition** — without it, the likelihood of developing arthritis is significantly lower, as seen in the case of rheumatoid arthritis, where individuals with a family history of the disease are more likely to develop it, such as the high incidence of rheumatoid arthritis among certain Native American populations (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).
- **Hormonal Balance** — hormonal imbalances, particularly with estrogen and testosterone, can contribute to the development of arthritis, as evidenced by the increased risk of osteoarthritis in postmenopausal women due to decreased estrogen levels (National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases).
- **Obesity** — excess weight puts additional stress on joints, leading to increased wear and tear, and a higher risk of developing osteoarthritis, as seen in a study where obese individuals were more likely to require joint replacement surgery (American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons).
- **Infection** — certain infections, such as Lyme disease, can trigger the onset of arthritis, as seen in the case of Lyme arthritis, where the bacterial infection can cause joint inflammation and pain (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases).
- **Joint Trauma** — injuries to joints can increase the risk of developing osteoarthritis, as evidenced by the high incidence of osteoarthritis among former athletes who have experienced joint injuries (American Journal of Sports Medicine).
- **Age** — as people age, the risk of developing osteoarthritis increases, due to the natural wear and tear on joints over time, as seen in the high prevalence of osteoarthritis among older adults (World Health Organization).

## Priority Order
The dependencies can be ranked from most to least critical as follows:
- Genetic predisposition: this is the most critical dependency, as it determines an individual's susceptibility to the disease, and without it, the likelihood of developing arthritis is significantly lower.
- Hormonal balance: this is the second most critical dependency, as hormonal imbalances can contribute to the development of arthritis, and changes in hormone levels can trigger the onset of the disease.
- Obesity: this is the third most critical dependency, as excess weight puts additional stress on joints, leading to increased wear and tear, and a higher risk of developing osteoarthritis.
- Infection: this is the fourth most critical dependency, as certain infections can trigger the onset of arthritis, but the risk of developing arthritis due to infection is generally lower than the risk associated with genetic predisposition, hormonal balance, and obesity.
- Joint trauma: this is the fifth most critical dependency, as injuries to joints can increase the risk of developing osteoarthritis, but the risk is generally lower than the risk associated with the above dependencies.
- Age: this is the least critical dependency, as while age is a risk factor for osteoarthritis, it is a natural process that cannot be changed, and the risk associated with age is generally lower than the risk associated with the above dependencies.

## Common Gaps
People often overlook the importance of **hormonal balance** in the development of arthritis, assuming that the disease is solely caused by wear and tear on joints, and neglecting the role of hormonal imbalances in triggering the onset of the disease, which can lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment, as seen in the case of rheumatoid arthritis, where hormonal imbalances can contribute to the development of the disease (National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases).
