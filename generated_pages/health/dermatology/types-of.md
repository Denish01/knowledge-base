# Types of Dermatology

There are several categories of dermatology, organized by the type of skin condition or disease being treated, including **Cosmetic Dermatology**, **Medical Dermatology**, **Surgical Dermatology**, and **Pediatric Dermatology**. 
**Cosmetic Dermatology** — focuses on the aesthetic improvement of the skin, including treatments like botulinum toxin injections for wrinkle reduction, as seen in the work of dermatologist **Dr. Fredric Brandt**, who popularized the use of botulinum toxin for cosmetic purposes. 
**Medical Dermatology** — involves the diagnosis and treatment of skin diseases like psoriasis, with the **National Psoriasis Foundation** providing resources and support for patients with this condition. 
**Surgical Dermatology** — encompasses the surgical treatment of skin conditions, including skin cancer removal, as performed by dermatologic surgeons like **Dr. Mohs**, who developed the Mohs surgery technique for removing skin cancer. 
**Pediatric Dermatology** — specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of skin conditions in infants, children, and adolescents, such as **Dr. Lawrence Green**, who has written extensively on pediatric dermatology.

## Main Categories
- **Cosmetic Dermatology** — focuses on the aesthetic improvement of the skin, including treatments like chemical peels, microdermabrasion, and laser skin resurfacing, with **Dr. Zein Obagi**'s **Obagi Skin Health Institute** offering a range of cosmetic dermatology services.
- **Medical Dermatology** — involves the diagnosis and treatment of skin diseases like acne, eczema, and dermatitis, with the **American Academy of Dermatology** providing guidance on the treatment of these conditions.
- **Surgical Dermatology** — encompasses the surgical treatment of skin conditions, including skin cancer removal, scar revision, and reconstructive surgery, with **Dr. Sumner A. Slavin**'s work on surgical dermatology highlighting the importance of this specialty.
- **Pediatric Dermatology** — specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of skin conditions in infants, children, and adolescents, such as **Dr. Amy Paller**'s research on pediatric skin diseases, including **epidermolysis bullosa**, a rare genetic disorder that affects the skin.

## How They Relate
**Cosmetic Dermatology** and **Medical Dermatology** often overlap, as cosmetic procedures can be used to treat medical skin conditions, such as using **botulinum toxin** to treat **hyperhidrosis**, a condition characterized by excessive sweating. 
**Surgical Dermatology** and **Medical Dermatology** also intersect, as surgical procedures are often used to treat skin diseases, such as **Mohs surgery** for skin cancer removal. 
**Pediatric Dermatology** and **Medical Dermatology** are closely related, as pediatric dermatologists often treat skin conditions that require medical management, such as **atopic dermatitis**, a common condition in children. 
Specific pairs of categories that are commonly confused include **Cosmetic Dermatology** and **Surgical Dermatology**, as both involve procedures that can be used for aesthetic improvement, but **Surgical Dermatology** is a distinct specialty that requires additional training and expertise.
