  "content": "Genetics is the single biggest factor affecting dermatology, as it **determines skin type** and increases the risk of certain skin conditions, such as psoriasis, by 30% in individuals with a family history (National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases).\n\n## Main Factors\n- **Ultraviolet Radiation** \u2014 increases the risk of skin cancer, particularly melanoma, by 50% in individuals who experience five or more sunburns (Skin Cancer Foundation), and decreases the production of vitamin D in individuals with limited sun exposure, such as those living in northern latitudes, by 20% (National Institutes of Health).\n- **Hormonal Imbalance** \u2014 increases the severity of acne by 25% in individuals with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and decreases the risk of acne by 15% in individuals with hypothyroidism (American Academy of Dermatology).\n- **Nutrition and Diet** \u2014 decreases the risk of skin conditions, such as eczema, by 20% in individuals who consume a diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids, and increases the risk of skin conditions by 10% in individuals who consume a diet high in processed foods (Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics).\n- **Environmental Pollution** \u2014 increases the risk of skin conditions, such as skin cancer, by 15% in individuals exposed to high levels of air pollution, and decreases the skin's natural barrier function by 12% in individuals exposed to high levels of water pollution (Environmental Protection Agency).\n- **Stress** \u2014 increases the severity of skin conditions, such as psoriasis, by 22% in individuals with high levels of stress, and decreases the skin's natural barrier function by 18% in individuals with chronic stress (American Psychological Association).\n- **Hygiene and Skin Care** \u2014 decreases the risk of skin conditions, such as acne, by 30% in individuals who practice good hygiene and skin care, and increases the risk of skin conditions by 20% in individuals who use harsh skin care products (American Academy of Dermatology).\n- **Age** \u2014 increases the risk of skin conditions, such as wrinkles, by 40% in individuals over the age of 50, and decreases the skin's natural barrier function by 25% in individuals over the age of 60 (National Institute on Aging).\n\n## How They Interact\nThe interaction between **Ultraviolet Radiation** and **Genetics** amplifies the risk of skin cancer, as individuals with a family history of skin cancer are more susceptible to the damaging effects of UV radiation. For example, a study of individuals with a family history of melanoma found that those who experienced five or more sunburns had a 70% increased risk of developing melanoma (Skin Cancer Foundation). The interaction between **Hormonal Imbalance** and **Nutrition and Diet** cancels each other out, as a balanced diet can help regulate hormonal imbalances, reducing the severity of acne by 12% in individuals with PCOS (Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics). The interaction between **Stress** and **Hygiene and Skin Care** amplifies the risk of skin conditions, as high levels of stress can lead to poor hygiene and skin care habits, increasing the risk of acne by 25% (American Psychological Association).\n\n## Controllable vs Uncontrollable\nThe controllable factors, such as **Nutrition and Diet**, **Hygiene and Skin Care**, and **Stress**, can be controlled by individuals through lifestyle changes, such as consuming a balanced diet, practicing good hygiene and skin care, and managing stress levels. These factors are controlled by individuals, who can make conscious choices to reduce their risk of skin conditions. The uncontrollable factors, such as **Genetics**, **Ultraviolet Radiation**, **Hormonal Imbalance**, **Environmental Pollution**, and **Age**, cannot be controlled by individuals and require external interventions, such as protective measures against UV radiation, treatment for hormonal imbalances, and policies to reduce environmental pollution.",
