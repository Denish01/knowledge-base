  "content": "There are several categories of dermatology, organized by the type of skin condition or disease being treated, including **Cosmetic Dermatology**, **Medical Dermatology**, **Surgical Dermatology**, and **Pediatric Dermatology**. \n**Cosmetic Dermatology** \u2014 focuses on the aesthetic improvement of the skin, including treatments like botulinum toxin injections for wrinkle reduction, as seen in the work of dermatologist **Dr. Fredric Brandt**, who popularized the use of botulinum toxin for cosmetic purposes. \n**Medical Dermatology** \u2014 involves the diagnosis and treatment of skin diseases like psoriasis, with the **National Psoriasis Foundation** providing resources and support for patients with this condition. \n**Surgical Dermatology** \u2014 encompasses the surgical treatment of skin conditions, including skin cancer removal, as performed by dermatologic surgeons like **Dr. Mohs**, who developed the Mohs surgery technique for removing skin cancer. \n**Pediatric Dermatology** \u2014 specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of skin conditions in infants, children, and adolescents, such as **Dr. Lawrence Green**, who has written extensively on pediatric dermatology.\n\n## Main Categories\n- **Cosmetic Dermatology** \u2014 focuses on the aesthetic improvement of the skin, including treatments like chemical peels, microdermabrasion, and laser skin resurfacing, with **Dr. Zein Obagi**'s **Obagi Skin Health Institute** offering a range of cosmetic dermatology services.\n- **Medical Dermatology** \u2014 involves the diagnosis and treatment of skin diseases like acne, eczema, and dermatitis, with the **American Academy of Dermatology** providing guidance on the treatment of these conditions.\n- **Surgical Dermatology** \u2014 encompasses the surgical treatment of skin conditions, including skin cancer removal, scar revision, and reconstructive surgery, with **Dr. Sumner A. Slavin**'s work on surgical dermatology highlighting the importance of this specialty.\n- **Pediatric Dermatology** \u2014 specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of skin conditions in infants, children, and adolescents, such as **Dr. Amy Paller**'s research on pediatric skin diseases, including **epidermolysis bullosa**, a rare genetic disorder that affects the skin.\n\n## Comparison Table\n| Category | Cost | Scale | Speed |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Cosmetic Dermatology** | High | Small-scale | Fast |\n| **Medical Dermatology** | Medium | Medium-scale | Medium |\n| **Surgical Dermatology** | High | Large-scale | Slow |\n| **Pediatric Dermatology** | Medium | Small-scale | Medium |\n\n## How They Relate\n**Cosmetic Dermatology** and **Medical Dermatology** often overlap, as cosmetic procedures can be used to treat medical skin conditions, such as using **botulinum toxin** to treat **hyperhidrosis**, a condition characterized by excessive sweating. \n**Surgical Dermatology** and **Medical Dermatology** also intersect, as surgical procedures are often used to treat skin diseases, such as **Mohs surgery** for skin cancer removal. \n**Pediatric Dermatology** and **Medical Dermatology** are closely related, as pediatric dermatologists often treat skin conditions that require medical management, such as **atopic dermatitis**, a common condition in children. \nSpecific pairs of categories that are commonly confused include **Cosmetic Dermatology** and **Surgical Dermatology**, as both involve procedures that can be used for aesthetic improvement, but **Surgical Dermatology** is a distinct specialty that requires additional training and expertise.",
