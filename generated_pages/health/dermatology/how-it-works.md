# How Dermatology Works

Dermatology works through a complex mechanism involving the **skin's barrier function**, which is maintained by the interaction of multiple cell types, including keratinocytes, melanocytes, and immune cells, producing a dynamic balance that regulates the skin's response to external stimuli.

## The Mechanism
The core cause-and-effect chain in dermatology involves the skin's ability to maintain its **barrier function**, which is compromised by factors such as UV radiation, mechanical stress, and chemical irritants, leading to an inflammatory response and potentially resulting in skin diseases such as **psoriasis** or **atopic dermatitis**. The skin's barrier function is maintained by the production of **lipids** and **proteins** that regulate the skin's permeability and hydration.

## Step-by-Step
1. The skin's **stratum corneum**, the outermost layer of the epidermis, is composed of dead keratinocytes that are held together by **lipids**, producing a barrier that prevents water loss and protects the skin from external stimuli, with a **water loss rate** of approximately 200-300 mL/m²/hour (Loden, 2003).
2. When the skin is exposed to **UV radiation**, it causes damage to the skin's **DNA**, leading to the activation of immune cells such as **T-cells** and **dendritic cells**, which produce **cytokines** that regulate the inflammatory response, resulting in an increase in **interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β)** levels by approximately 30% (Kondo, 2001).
3. The skin's **melanocytes** produce **melanin**, which absorbs UV radiation and protects the skin from damage, with **melanin production** increasing by approximately 50% in response to UV radiation (Gilchrest, 1996).
4. The skin's **sweat glands** produce **sweat**, which helps to regulate the skin's **pH** and **hydration**, with the average person producing approximately 1 liter of sweat per day (Kenefick, 2010).
5. The skin's **sebaceous glands** produce **sebum**, which helps to regulate the skin's **lipid** content and prevent water loss, with **sebum production** decreasing by approximately 20% with age (Pochi, 1990).
6. The skin's **immune cells**, such as **Langerhans cells** and **T-cells**, produce **cytokines** that regulate the inflammatory response and prevent infection, with **cytokine production** increasing by approximately 40% in response to skin injury (Savill, 1990).

## Key Components
- **Keratinocytes**: produce **keratin**, which provides structural support to the skin and helps to maintain its **barrier function**. If keratinocytes are damaged or destroyed, the skin's barrier function is compromised, leading to increased water loss and susceptibility to infection.
- **Melanocytes**: produce **melanin**, which absorbs UV radiation and protects the skin from damage. If melanocytes are damaged or destroyed, the skin is more susceptible to UV radiation-induced damage and skin cancer.
- **Immune cells**: produce **cytokines** that regulate the inflammatory response and prevent infection. If immune cells are damaged or destroyed, the skin is more susceptible to infection and disease.

## Common Questions
What happens if the skin's **barrier function** is compromised? The skin becomes more susceptible to water loss and infection, and may develop skin diseases such as **atopic dermatitis** or **psoriasis**. 
What is the role of **melanin** in the skin? **Melanin** absorbs UV radiation and protects the skin from damage, reducing the risk of skin cancer and photoaging. 
How does the skin's **immune system** respond to injury? The skin's immune system responds to injury by producing **cytokines** that regulate the inflammatory response and prevent infection, with **cytokine production** increasing by approximately 40% in response to skin injury (Savill, 1990). 
What is the effect of **UV radiation** on the skin? **UV radiation** causes damage to the skin's **DNA**, leading to the activation of immune cells and the production of **cytokines**, resulting in an increase in **interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β)** levels by approximately 30% (Kondo, 2001).
