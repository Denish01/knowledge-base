# What Is Mental Health?

## Definition
Mental health is a state of well-being in which an individual realizes their own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively, and is able to make a contribution to their community, as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO).

## How It Works
Mental health is influenced by a complex interplay of biological, psychological, and social factors. The **biopsychosocial model**, developed by George Engel in 1977, provides a framework for understanding the relationships between these factors. According to this model, mental health is shaped by the interaction of biological factors, such as genetics and neurochemistry, psychological factors, such as thoughts and emotions, and social factors, such as relationships and environment. For example, the presence of a mental health disorder can affect an individual's ability to work productively, with the WHO estimating that depression and anxiety disorders cost the global economy approximately $1 trillion in lost productivity annually (WHO).

The **stress-diathesis model** also provides insight into the development of mental health disorders. This model suggests that individuals with a predisposition to a mental health disorder are more likely to develop the disorder when exposed to stressful life events. The model is supported by research on the impact of adverse childhood experiences, such as abuse or neglect, on the development of mental health disorders later in life. The Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) study, conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), found that individuals who experienced four or more adverse childhood experiences were at increased risk of developing depression, anxiety, and other mental health disorders.

Mental health can also be influenced by social and environmental factors, such as socioeconomic status, education, and access to healthcare. The **social determinants of health** framework, developed by the WHO, highlights the importance of these factors in shaping mental health outcomes. For example, individuals with lower socioeconomic status may experience greater financial stress, which can contribute to the development of mental health disorders. The WHO estimates that approximately 30% of individuals with mental health disorders in low-income countries do not receive treatment due to lack of access to healthcare services.

## Key Components
- **Emotional regulation**: the ability to manage and regulate emotions, which is critical for maintaining mental health. When emotional regulation increases, individuals are better able to cope with stress and adversity, and when it decreases, they may be more likely to experience mood disorders.
- **Cognitive functioning**: the ability to process and interpret information, which is essential for problem-solving and decision-making. When cognitive functioning increases, individuals are better able to adapt to changing circumstances, and when it decreases, they may experience cognitive impairment.
- **Social support**: the presence of supportive relationships, which can provide emotional support and practical assistance. When social support increases, individuals are better able to cope with stress and adversity, and when it decreases, they may be more likely to experience feelings of loneliness and isolation.
- **Self-esteem**: the evaluation of one's own worth and abilities, which can influence mental health outcomes. When self-esteem increases, individuals are more likely to experience confidence and self-efficacy, and when it decreases, they may experience self-doubt and low self-worth.
- **Resilience**: the ability to adapt to and recover from adversity, which is critical for maintaining mental health. When resilience increases, individuals are better able to cope with stress and adversity, and when it decreases, they may be more likely to experience mental health disorders.

## Common Misconceptions
**Myth:** Mental health disorders are a sign of weakness — **Fact:** Mental health disorders are a result of a complex interplay of biological, psychological, and social factors, and individuals with mental health disorders are not weak, but rather, they are struggling with a serious health condition (WHO).
**Myth:** Mental health disorders only affect individuals with a family history of mental health disorders — **Fact:** Mental health disorders can affect anyone, regardless of their family history, and are influenced by a range of factors, including socioeconomic status, education, and access to healthcare (CDC).
**Myth:** Mental health disorders are not treatable — **Fact:** Mental health disorders are treatable, and a range of effective treatments are available, including medication, therapy, and lifestyle changes, such as regular exercise and healthy eating (National Institute of Mental Health).
**Myth:** Mental health disorders are rare — **Fact:** Mental health disorders are common, with approximately 1 in 4 individuals experiencing a mental health disorder each year, and approximately 1 in 2 individuals experiencing a mental health disorder at some point in their lifetime (WHO).

## In Practice
The **Mental Health Action Plan**, developed by the WHO, provides a framework for improving mental health outcomes globally. The plan emphasizes the importance of increasing access to mental health services, particularly in low-income countries, where mental health services are often limited. For example, in Rwanda, the government has implemented a mental health program that provides training for community health workers to provide mental health services, including counseling and medication management. The program has resulted in a significant increase in access to mental health services, with approximately 70% of individuals with mental health disorders receiving treatment (WHO). The program has also resulted in a significant reduction in the economic burden of mental health disorders, with the WHO estimating that the program has saved approximately $10 million in lost productivity annually (WHO).
