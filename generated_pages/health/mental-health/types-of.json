  "content": "There are six main categories of mental health, organized by their primary characteristics and impact on an individual's well-being. \n## Main Categories\n- **Anxiety Disorders** \u2014 characterized by excessive fear and anxiety, distinguishing characteristics include persistent and overwhelming worry, and a concrete example is **Panic Disorder**, as seen in the case of Howard Hughes, who struggled with anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder.\n- **Mood Disorders** \u2014 marked by significant disturbances in emotional states, distinguishing characteristics include persistent feelings of sadness or irritability, and a concrete example is **Major Depressive Disorder**, as experienced by actress Catherine Zeta-Jones, who has been open about her struggles with bipolar disorder.\n- **Personality Disorders** \u2014 characterized by enduring patterns of inner experience and behavior that deviate from cultural norms, distinguishing characteristics include inflexible and maladaptive traits, and a concrete example is **Borderline Personality Disorder**, as depicted in the case of actress Britney Spears, who has been reported to exhibit symptoms of the disorder.\n- **Psychotic Disorders** \u2014 marked by a disconnection from reality, distinguishing characteristics include hallucinations and delusions, and a concrete example is **Schizophrenia**, as experienced by mathematician John Nash, who struggled with paranoid schizophrenia.\n- **Trauma and Stressor-Related Disorders** \u2014 characterized by exposure to a traumatic or stressful event, distinguishing characteristics include intrusive memories and avoidance of stimuli, and a concrete example is **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)**, as seen in the case of soldiers returning from combat, such as former US Senator Bob Kerrey, who has spoken publicly about his experiences with PTSD.\n- **Neurodevelopmental Disorders** \u2014 marked by difficulties with brain development and function, distinguishing characteristics include impaired cognitive, social, and emotional functioning, and a concrete example is **Autism Spectrum Disorder**, as experienced by animal scientist Temple Grandin, who has been open about her autism diagnosis and has written extensively on the topic.\n\n## Comparison Table\n| Category | Primary Symptoms | Typical Age of Onset | Treatment Options |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Anxiety Disorders | Excessive fear and anxiety | Childhood or adolescence | Psychotherapy, medication, lifestyle changes |\n| Mood Disorders | Persistent feelings of sadness or irritability | Adulthood, although can occur at any age | Medication, psychotherapy, lifestyle changes |\n| Personality Disorders | Inflexible and maladaptive traits | Late adolescence or early adulthood | Psychotherapy, medication, lifestyle changes |\n| Psychotic Disorders | Hallucinations and delusions | Late adolescence or early adulthood | Medication, psychotherapy, hospitalization |\n| Trauma and Stressor-Related Disorders | Intrusive memories and avoidance of stimuli | Any age, although often following a traumatic event | Psychotherapy, medication, lifestyle changes |\n| Neurodevelopmental Disorders | Impaired cognitive, social, and emotional functioning | Childhood or adolescence | Early intervention, special education, medication |\n\n## How They Relate\nThe categories of mental health are not mutually exclusive, and individuals may experience co-occurring disorders, such as **comorbid anxiety and depressive disorders**, which can complicate diagnosis and treatment. For example, **anxiety disorders** and **mood disorders** often overlap, as anxiety can contribute to the development of depression, and depression can exacerbate anxiety symptoms. Additionally, **trauma and stressor-related disorders** can increase the risk of developing **anxiety disorders**, **mood disorders**, and **psychotic disorders**, highlighting the importance of early intervention and treatment. Furthermore, **personality disorders** can be commonly confused with **mood disorders**, as the emotional dysregulation characteristic of personality disorders can be mistaken for mood symptoms, emphasizing the need for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning.",
