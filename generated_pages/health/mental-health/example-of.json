  "content": "## Definition\nMental health is a state of well-being in which an individual realizes their own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively, and is able to make a contribution to their community, as described by the World Health Organization.\n\n## How It Works\nMental health is influenced by a combination of genetic, environmental, and psychological factors, including **stress**, **trauma**, and **social support**. The biopsychosocial model, developed by George Engel in 1977, explains how mental health is shaped by the interplay between biological, psychological, and social factors. For example, the brain's stress response system, known as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, can be triggered by stressors such as job loss or relationship problems, leading to the release of stress hormones like cortisol, which can have a negative impact on mental health if chronically elevated, with approximately 1 in 5 adults in the United States experiencing mental illness each year (National Institute of Mental Health).\n\nThe impact of mental health on daily life can be significant, with mental illness costing the global economy approximately $2.5 trillion annually (World Health Organization). Mental health can also affect physical health, with chronic stress increasing the risk of developing conditions like **hypertension** and **diabetes**. The **transactional model of stress**, developed by Richard Lazarus in 1966, explains how individuals appraise and cope with stressors, and how this process can affect their mental health. For instance, individuals who use **maladaptive coping strategies**, such as substance abuse or avoidance, may be more likely to experience poor mental health outcomes.\n\nMental health can also be influenced by **social determinants**, such as socioeconomic status, education, and housing. The **social learning theory**, developed by Albert Bandura in 1977, explains how individuals learn behaviors and attitudes by observing others, and how this process can shape their mental health. For example, individuals who grow up in poverty may be more likely to experience mental health problems due to chronic stress and limited access to resources, with approximately 1 in 10 children in the United States living in poverty (US Census Bureau).\n\n## Key Components\n- **Cognitive-behavioral therapy** helps individuals identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to mental health problems, with approximately 50% of individuals experiencing significant improvement in symptoms (Butler et al.).\n- **Social support** from family, friends, and community members can provide emotional support, practical assistance, and a sense of belonging, with individuals who have strong social support networks tend to have better mental health outcomes (Cohen et al.).\n- **Stress management** techniques, such as **mindfulness** and **relaxation**, can help individuals cope with stress and reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression, with approximately 30% of individuals experiencing significant reduction in symptoms (Hofmann et al.).\n- **Physical activity** can help reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression, improve mood, and enhance cognitive function, with approximately 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week recommended for adults (World Health Organization).\n- **Sleep** is essential for mental health, with approximately 7-9 hours of sleep per night recommended for adults, and chronic sleep deprivation increasing the risk of developing mental health problems (National Sleep Foundation).\n- **Nutrition** can also impact mental health, with a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains providing essential nutrients and antioxidants that support mental health, with approximately 50% of individuals experiencing improved mental health outcomes when following a healthy diet (Lai et al.).\n\n## Common Misconceptions\n**Myth:** Mental illness is a sign of weakness \u2014 **Fact:** Mental illness is a medical condition that can affect anyone, regardless of their strength or resilience, with approximately 1 in 5 adults in the United States experiencing mental illness each year (National Institute of Mental Health).\n**Myth:** People with mental illness are violent \u2014 **Fact:** The vast majority of people with mental illness are not violent, and are more likely to be victims of violence than perpetrators, with approximately 1 in 10 individuals with mental illness experiencing violence (National Institute of Mental Health).\n**Myth:** Mental health treatment is only for severe mental illness \u2014 **Fact:** Mental health treatment can be beneficial for anyone experiencing mental health problems, regardless of their severity, with approximately 50% of individuals experiencing significant improvement in symptoms with treatment (Butler et al.).\n**Myth:** Mental health problems are rare \u2014 **Fact:** Mental health problems are common, with approximately 1 in 5 adults in the United States experiencing mental illness each year, and approximately 1 in 10 children in the United States experiencing mental health problems (National Institute of Mental Health).\n\n## In Practice\nThe **Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act** of 2008 in the United States requires health insurance plans to provide equal coverage for mental health and substance use disorders as they do for medical and surgical care, with approximately 100 million individuals benefiting from the law (US Department of Health and Human Services). The **National Alliance on Mental Illness** (NAMI) provides education, support, and advocacy for individuals and families affected by mental illness, with approximately 500,000 individuals participating in NAMI programs each year (NAMI). The **World Health Organization** (WHO) provides global leadership on mental health, with approximately 100 countries participating in WHO's mental health programs, and a budget of approximately $100 million dedicated to mental health initiatives (World Health Organization).",
