# How Mental Health Works

Mental health is governed by the **stress-diathesis model**, which describes how an individual's underlying **predisposition** and **coping mechanisms** interact with **stressors** to produce **mental health outcomes**.

## The Mechanism
The core cause-and-effect chain in mental health involves the interaction between **genetic factors**, **environmental factors**, and **cognitive processes**, which produce **emotional responses** and **behavioral outcomes**. This interaction is mediated by **neurotransmitters** such as serotonin and dopamine, which regulate **mood** and **motivation**.

## Step-by-Step
1. The process begins with the perception of a **stressor**, such as a **traumatic event** or a **chronic stress**, which activates the **hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis**, producing a **cortisol** response of approximately 10-20 ng/mL (American Psychological Association).
2. The **cortisol** response triggers a **fight-or-flight response**, characterized by an increase in **heart rate** of 10-20 beats per minute and **blood pressure** of 5-10 mmHg, preparing the individual to respond to the **stressor** (National Institute of Mental Health).
3. The individual's **coping mechanisms**, such as **problem-focused coping** or **emotion-focused coping**, are then activated to manage the **stressor**, with **effective coping** reducing **cortisol** levels by 20-30% and **ineffective coping** increasing **cortisol** levels by 10-20% (Lazarus and Folkman's transactional model).
4. The **stress-diathesis model** suggests that an individual's underlying **predisposition**, such as a **genetic predisposition** to **depression**, interacts with the **stressor** to produce a **mental health outcome**, with **high-risk individuals** experiencing a 2-3 fold increase in **symptom severity** (Kessler's epidemiological studies).
5. The **mental health outcome** is then influenced by **social support**, with **strong social support** reducing **symptom severity** by 10-20% and **weak social support** increasing **symptom severity** by 5-10% (Cohen's social support theory).
6. Finally, the **mental health outcome** is maintained or changed through **cognitive processes**, such as **rumination** or **cognitive reappraisal**, which can increase or decrease **symptom severity** by 5-10% (Gross's emotion regulation theory).

## Key Components
- **Genetic factors**: influence an individual's **predisposition** to **mental health disorders**, with certain **genetic variants** increasing the risk of **depression** by 1.5-2.5 fold (Caspi's genetic studies).
- **Environmental factors**: contribute to an individual's **stress** levels, with **chronic stress** increasing the risk of **anxiety disorders** by 2-3 fold (McEwen's stress studies).
- **Cognitive processes**: regulate an individual's **emotional responses** and **behavioral outcomes**, with **cognitive-behavioral therapy** reducing **symptom severity** by 20-30% (Beck's cognitive theory).
- **Neurotransmitters**: mediate the interaction between **genetic factors**, **environmental factors**, and **cognitive processes**, with **selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors** increasing **serotonin** levels by 10-20% and reducing **symptom severity** by 20-30% (Healy's psychopharmacology studies).

## Common Questions
What happens if an individual's **coping mechanisms** are **ineffective**? Ineffective **coping mechanisms** can increase **cortisol** levels and **symptom severity**, leading to a 2-3 fold increase in the risk of **mental health disorders** (Lazarus and Folkman's transactional model). 
What is the role of **social support** in maintaining **mental health**? **Strong social support** can reduce **symptom severity** by 10-20% and increase **resilience** by 5-10% (Cohen's social support theory). 
What are the consequences of **chronic stress** on **mental health**? **Chronic stress** can increase the risk of **anxiety disorders** by 2-3 fold and **depression** by 1.5-2.5 fold (McEwen's stress studies). 
How do **genetic factors** influence an individual's **predisposition** to **mental health disorders**? Certain **genetic variants** can increase the risk of **depression** by 1.5-2.5 fold and **anxiety disorders** by 2-3 fold (Caspi's genetic studies).
