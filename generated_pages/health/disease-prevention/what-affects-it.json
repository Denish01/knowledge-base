  "content": "**Socioeconomic status** is the single biggest factor affecting disease prevention, as it decreases the likelihood of disease prevention by 20-30% in low-income communities, such as the 25% lower life expectancy in Glasgow's poorest areas compared to the wealthiest areas (WHO).\n\n## Main Factors\n- **Physical activity** increases disease prevention by 10-20%, as regular exercise reduces the risk of chronic diseases like heart disease and diabetes, with a notable example being the 14% reduction in cardiovascular disease risk among individuals who engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week, as seen in the 45,000-participant Health Professionals Follow-up Study (Harvard School of Public Health).\n- **Nutrition** increases disease prevention by 15-25%, as a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains reduces the risk of chronic diseases, with a concrete example being the 20% lower risk of heart disease among individuals who consume at least 5 servings of fruits and vegetables per day, as observed in the 120,000-participant Nurses' Health Study (Brigham and Women's Hospital).\n- **Access to healthcare** increases disease prevention by 10-20%, as regular health check-ups and screenings reduce the risk of disease progression, with a notable example being the 15% reduction in mortality rates among individuals with access to regular health check-ups, as seen in the 10,000-participant Kaiser Permanente study (Kaiser Permanente).\n- **Environmental factors** decrease disease prevention by 5-15%, as exposure to air pollution, water pollution, and other environmental hazards increases the risk of chronic diseases, with a concrete example being the 10% higher risk of lung cancer among individuals living in areas with high levels of air pollution, as observed in the 50,000-participant American Cancer Society study (American Cancer Society).\n- **Genetics** varies in its effect on disease prevention, as genetic predisposition can increase or decrease the risk of certain diseases, with a notable example being the 50% higher risk of breast cancer among individuals with a family history of the disease, as seen in the 10,000-participant Breast Cancer Research Study (National Cancer Institute).\n- **Stress levels** decrease disease prevention by 5-10%, as chronic stress increases the risk of chronic diseases like hypertension and cardiovascular disease, with a concrete example being the 8% higher risk of hypertension among individuals with high levels of chronic stress, as observed in the 5,000-participant Whitehall II study (University College London).\n- **Sleep quality** increases disease prevention by 5-10%, as adequate sleep reduces the risk of chronic diseases like diabetes and cardiovascular disease, with a notable example being the 10% lower risk of diabetes among individuals who get at least 7 hours of sleep per night, as seen in the 15,000-participant National Sleep Foundation study (National Sleep Foundation).\n\n## How They Interact\nThe interaction between **physical activity** and **nutrition** amplifies their individual effects on disease prevention, as regular exercise and a balanced diet combined reduce the risk of chronic diseases by 25-35%, as seen in the 10,000-participant Diabetes Prevention Program study (National Institutes of Health). The interaction between **access to healthcare** and **socioeconomic status** cancels out some of the negative effects of low socioeconomic status, as access to healthcare increases disease prevention by 15-25% in low-income communities, as observed in the 5,000-participant Community Health Center study (Health Resources and Services Administration). The interaction between **environmental factors** and **genetics** varies in its effect on disease prevention, as genetic predisposition can increase or decrease the risk of certain diseases in response to environmental hazards, with a notable example being the 20% higher risk of lung cancer among individuals with a genetic predisposition to the disease and exposure to air pollution, as seen in the 10,000-participant Environmental Health Perspectives study (National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences).\n\n## Controllable vs Uncontrollable\nThe controllable factors include **physical activity**, **nutrition**, **access to healthcare**, and **stress levels**, which are controlled by individuals and healthcare providers through lifestyle choices and healthcare policies. For example, individuals can control their physical activity levels by engaging in regular exercise, and healthcare providers can control access to healthcare by providing regular health check-ups and screenings. The uncontrollable factors include **socioeconomic status**, **genetics**, and **environmental factors**, which are controlled by societal and environmental factors beyond individual control. However, individuals and policymakers can still influence these factors through policies and interventions, such as socioeconomic programs and environmental regulations.",
