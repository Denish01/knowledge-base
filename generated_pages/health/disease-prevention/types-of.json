  "content": "There are three primary categories of disease prevention, organized by the level of intervention: **Primary Prevention**, **Secondary Prevention**, and **Tertiary Prevention**.\n\n## Main Categories\n- **Primary Prevention** \u2014 focuses on preventing the onset of disease through measures such as vaccination, health education, and lifestyle modifications, as seen in the **Polio Eradication Initiative** led by the World Health Organization.\n- **Secondary Prevention** \u2014 aims to detect and treat disease at an early stage, often through screening programs, to prevent further progression, exemplified by the **National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program** in the United States.\n- **Tertiary Prevention** \u2014 involves the management of disease after it has occurred, with the goal of reducing its impact and preventing further complications, as illustrated by the **Diabetes Control Program** implemented by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n## Comparison Table\n| Category | Cost | Scale | Speed | Risk |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Primary Prevention** | Low to moderate (e.g., vaccination programs) | Large population | Long-term | Low |\n| **Secondary Prevention** | Moderate (e.g., screening tests) | Targeted population | Medium-term | Moderate |\n| **Tertiary Prevention** | High (e.g., disease management programs) | Individual or small group | Short-term | High |\n\n## How They Relate\nThe categories of disease prevention are interconnected, with **Primary Prevention** laying the foundation for **Secondary Prevention**, which in turn informs **Tertiary Prevention**. For example, a vaccination program (primary prevention) can reduce the incidence of a disease, thereby decreasing the need for screening (secondary prevention) and subsequent disease management (tertiary prevention). However, if primary prevention measures are insufficient, secondary prevention becomes more critical. The **National High Blood Pressure Education Program** demonstrates how these categories can overlap, as it combines elements of primary prevention (health education), secondary prevention (screening), and tertiary prevention (disease management) to address hypertension. Specific pairs, such as primary and secondary prevention, are often confused due to their overlapping goals, but they differ in their approaches, with primary prevention focusing on avoiding disease onset and secondary prevention aiming to detect and treat disease early.",
