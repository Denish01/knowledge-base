# What Disease Prevention Depends On

Effective disease prevention depends on **Vaccination** — a critical dependency that requires widespread coverage to prevent outbreaks, as seen in the 2019 measles outbreak in the United States where low vaccination rates in certain communities led to a significant increase in cases.

## Key Dependencies
- **Sanitation** — proper waste management and hygiene practices are necessary to prevent the spread of diseases, and without them, outbreaks can occur, such as the 2008 cholera outbreak in Zimbabwe where inadequate sanitation and water treatment led to over 4,000 deaths.
- **Surveillance** — monitoring disease trends and outbreaks is crucial for early detection and response, and without it, diseases can spread rapidly, as seen in the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa where delayed reporting and response led to a significant increase in cases and deaths.
- **Public Health Infrastructure** — a well-functioning healthcare system is necessary to provide preventive care, diagnose diseases, and treat patients, and without it, disease prevention efforts are severely hindered, as seen in the 1990s in Russia where a decline in public health infrastructure led to a significant increase in tuberculosis cases.
- **Community Engagement** — active participation and cooperation from the community are necessary for disease prevention efforts to be effective, and without it, programs can fail, as seen in the 2003 SARS outbreak in China where lack of community engagement and compliance with public health measures led to a significant increase in cases.
- **Funding** — sufficient funding is necessary to support disease prevention efforts, including vaccination programs, surveillance, and public health infrastructure, and without it, programs can be underfunded and ineffective, as seen in the 2017 yellow fever outbreak in Brazil where insufficient funding led to a shortage of vaccines.

## Priority Order
The dependencies can be ranked in order of priority as follows:
1. **Vaccination** — it is the most critical dependency because it provides direct protection against diseases and prevents outbreaks.
2. **Surveillance** — it is the second most critical dependency because it enables early detection and response to outbreaks, which can prevent the spread of diseases.
3. **Public Health Infrastructure** — it is the third most critical dependency because it provides the necessary healthcare services to diagnose and treat diseases.
4. **Sanitation** — it is the fourth most critical dependency because while it is necessary for preventing the spread of diseases, it can be addressed through other means, such as improved hygiene practices.
5. **Community Engagement** — it is the fifth most critical dependency because while it is necessary for disease prevention efforts to be effective, it can be addressed through public health campaigns and education.
6. **Funding** — it is the sixth most critical dependency because while it is necessary to support disease prevention efforts, it can be addressed through resource allocation and budgeting.

## Common Gaps
People often overlook the importance of **Sanitation** in disease prevention, assuming that it is a given in developed communities, but inadequate sanitation can lead to outbreaks, as seen in the 2010 cholera outbreak in Haiti where poor sanitation and inadequate waste management led to a significant increase in cases. Another common gap is the assumption that **Vaccination** is only necessary for children, when in fact, vaccination is necessary throughout life to prevent the spread of diseases, as seen in the 2019 measles outbreak in the United States where low vaccination rates among certain adult populations led to a significant increase in cases.
