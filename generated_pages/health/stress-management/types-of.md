# Types of Stress Management

There are three primary categories of stress management, which can be organized based on their approach to addressing stress: physical, emotional, and behavioral. 

## Main Categories
- **Physical Stress Management** — involves techniques that target the body's physiological response to stress, such as exercise, massage, and meditation, as seen in the **yoga** practice at the **Kripalu Center for Yoga & Health**.
- **Emotional Stress Management** — encompasses strategies that focus on emotional regulation and cognitive reappraisal, including **cognitive-behavioral therapy** (CBT) and **mindfulness-based stress reduction** (MBSR), as employed by the **National Alliance on Mental Illness**.
- **Behavioral Stress Management** — consists of methods that aim to modify maladaptive behaviors contributing to stress, such as **time management** and **assertiveness training**, as taught by the **Dale Carnegie Training** organization.

## Comparison Table
| Category | Cost | Scale | Speed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Physical Stress Management | Low-Moderate (e.g., **yoga** classes at $10-$20 per session) | Individual-Group | Short-Term (e.g., **meditation** sessions lasting 10-30 minutes) |
| Emotional Stress Management | Moderate-High (e.g., **CBT** sessions at $100-$200 per hour) | Individual | Medium-Term (e.g., **MBSR** programs spanning 8 weeks) |
| Behavioral Stress Management | Low-Moderate (e.g., **time management** workshops at $50-$100 per day) | Group-Organizational | Long-Term (e.g., **assertiveness training** programs lasting several months) |

## How They Relate
The categories of stress management often overlap and feed into each other, as **physical stress management** techniques like **exercise** can influence emotional states, while **emotional stress management** strategies like **CBT** can inform behavioral changes. Specific pairs, such as **yoga** (physical) and **mindfulness** (emotional), are commonly combined to create a holistic stress management approach. Additionally, **behavioral stress management** techniques like **time management** can be used in conjunction with **physical stress management** methods like **exercise** to create a comprehensive stress reduction plan, as seen in the **Wellness Program** at **Google**. The **American Psychological Association** (APA) recognizes the interplay between these categories, emphasizing the importance of a multi-faceted approach to stress management.
