# Types of Neurology

There are several categories of neurology, organized by the type of disorder or system affected, including **Central Nervous System Neurology**, **Peripheral Nervous System Neurology**, **Autonomic Nervous System Neurology**, and **Neuromuscular Neurology**. 
**Central Nervous System Neurology** — involves the brain and spinal cord, with distinguishing characteristics including complex cognitive and motor functions, and a concrete example being the treatment of **Alzheimer's disease** at the Mayo Clinic. 
**Peripheral Nervous System Neurology** — involves the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord, with distinguishing characteristics including control of voluntary movements, and a concrete example being the diagnosis of **Guillain-Barré syndrome** at the University of California, San Francisco. 
**Autonomic Nervous System Neurology** — involves the involuntary functions of the body, with distinguishing characteristics including control of heart rate and blood pressure, and a concrete example being the treatment of **Multiple System Atrophy** at the National Institutes of Health. 
**Neuromuscular Neurology** — involves the muscles and their control by the nervous system, with distinguishing characteristics including control of voluntary movements, and a concrete example being the diagnosis of **Duchenne muscular dystrophy** at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.

## Main Categories
- **Central Nervous System Neurology** involves the brain and spinal cord, with distinguishing characteristics including complex cognitive and motor functions, and a concrete example being the treatment of **Alzheimer's disease** at the Mayo Clinic, where researchers use **Ricardo's comparative advantage model** to optimize resource allocation.
- **Peripheral Nervous System Neurology** involves the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord, with distinguishing characteristics including control of voluntary movements, and a concrete example being the diagnosis of **Guillain-Barré syndrome** at the University of California, San Francisco, where clinicians use **electromyography** to assess nerve function.
- **Autonomic Nervous System Neurology** involves the involuntary functions of the body, with distinguishing characteristics including control of heart rate and blood pressure, and a concrete example being the treatment of **Multiple System Atrophy** at the National Institutes of Health, where scientists use **Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans** to study disease progression.
- **Neuromuscular Neurology** involves the muscles and their control by the nervous system, with distinguishing characteristics including control of voluntary movements, and a concrete example being the diagnosis of **Duchenne muscular dystrophy** at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, where researchers use **genetic testing** to identify mutations in the dystrophin gene.

## Comparison Table
| Category | Cost | Scale | Speed | Risk |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Central Nervous System Neurology** | High (~$100,000/year, Mayo Clinic) | Large (millions of patients, Alzheimer's Association) | Slow (years, National Institute on Aging) | High (cognitive decline, Alzheimer's disease) |
| **Peripheral Nervous System Neurology** | Medium (~$50,000/year, University of California, San Francisco) | Medium (thousands of patients, Guillain-Barré Syndrome Foundation) | Medium (months, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke) | Medium (nerve damage, Guillain-Barré syndrome) |
| **Autonomic Nervous System Neurology** | High (~$100,000/year, National Institutes of Health) | Small (hundreds of patients, Multiple System Atrophy Coalition) | Slow (years, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke) | High (organ failure, Multiple System Atrophy) |
| **Neuromuscular Neurology** | Medium (~$50,000/year, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia) | Medium (thousands of patients, Muscular Dystrophy Association) | Medium (months, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke) | Medium (muscle weakness, Duchenne muscular dystrophy) |

## How They Relate
The categories of neurology overlap and feed into each other in complex ways. For example, **Central Nervous System Neurology** and **Peripheral Nervous System Neurology** are closely related, as damage to the central nervous system can affect the peripheral nervous system, and vice versa, as seen in the diagnosis of **Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)**. Similarly, **Autonomic Nervous System Neurology** and **Neuromuscular Neurology** are related, as dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system can affect muscle function, and muscle dysfunction can affect autonomic nervous system function, as seen in the treatment of **Myasthenia Gravis**. Additionally, **Central Nervous System Neurology** and **Autonomic Nervous System Neurology** are related, as the central nervous system controls many autonomic functions, and dysfunction of the central nervous system can affect autonomic function, as seen in the diagnosis of **Parkinson's disease**. These relationships highlight the complexity and interconnectedness of the nervous system, and the need for a comprehensive approach to diagnosis and treatment.
