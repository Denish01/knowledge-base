# Common Misconceptions About Neurology

The notion that humans only use 10% of their brains is a pervasive myth that has been debunked by neurologists, with studies showing that brain imaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) reveal that different areas of the brain are active at different times, and even the supposedly "idle" areas are still performing important background functions (Kingsley 2006).

## Misconceptions
- **Myth:** Humans only use 10% of their brains
- **Fact:** Brain imaging techniques such as fMRI reveal that different areas of the brain are active at different times, and even the supposedly "idle" areas are still performing important background functions, with a study by Kingsley showing that the brain's neural networks are highly distributed and interconnected (Kingsley 2006)
- **Source of confusion:** This myth persists due to a 1907 book by psychologist and author William James, who wrote that "we are making use of only a small part of our mental resources," which was later misinterpreted and exaggerated by the media and popular culture
- **Myth:** Neuroplasticity is a recently discovered concept
- **Fact:** The concept of neuroplasticity was first introduced by neuroscientist Marian Diamond in the 1960s, who showed that the brain's neural connections can reorganize themselves in response to new experiences, with her work building on earlier research by neuroscientist Santiago Ramón y Cajal (Diamond 1967)
- **Source of confusion:** The idea that neuroplasticity is a new concept may stem from the fact that it has only recently become a widely accepted and popular topic in neuroscience and psychology
- **Myth:** Alzheimer's disease is an inevitable part of aging
- **Fact:** While age is a significant risk factor for Alzheimer's, it is not an inevitable part of aging, with many people living into their 90s and beyond without developing the disease, and research by Holtzman showing that certain lifestyle factors, such as regular exercise and social engagement, may help reduce the risk (Holtzman 2011)
- **Source of confusion:** The high prevalence of Alzheimer's disease among older adults may contribute to the misconception that it is an inevitable part of aging
- **Myth:** Brain damage is always permanent
- **Fact:** Depending on the type and severity of the damage, the brain's neural connections can reorganize themselves to compensate for damaged areas, a process known as compensatory neuroplasticity, with a study by Draganski showing that London taxi drivers, who must memorize complex maps, develop increased gray matter in areas of the brain associated with spatial memory (Draganski 2004)
- **Source of confusion:** The idea that brain damage is always permanent may stem from the fact that some types of brain damage, such as those caused by traumatic brain injury, can result in lasting cognitive and motor impairments
- **Myth:** Intelligence is fixed at birth
- **Fact:** Intelligence can be influenced by a variety of genetic and environmental factors, including education, nutrition, and socioeconomic status, with research by Turkheimer showing that the heritability of intelligence increases with age, but that environmental factors also play a significant role (Turkheimer 2003)
- **Source of confusion:** The idea that intelligence is fixed at birth may stem from the fact that some aspects of cognitive ability, such as processing speed, may be influenced by genetic factors
- **Myth:** Neurological disorders are rare
- **Fact:** Neurological disorders, such as stroke, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis, affect millions of people worldwide, with the World Health Organization estimating that over 1 billion people suffer from neurological disorders (World Health Organization)
- **Source of confusion:** The misconception that neurological disorders are rare may stem from the fact that they often receive less attention and funding than other types of diseases
