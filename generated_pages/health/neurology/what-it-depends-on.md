# What Neurology Depends On

Neurology depends on **neuroanatomy**, as a thorough understanding of the brain's structure is necessary to diagnose and treat neurological disorders, and the absence of this knowledge led to incorrect diagnoses and ineffective treatments in the case of Phineas Gage, whose severe brain injury was not fully understood due to limited knowledge of neuroanatomy at the time.

## Key Dependencies
- **Neuroanatomy** — a thorough understanding of the brain's structure is necessary to diagnose and treat neurological disorders, and without it, doctors may misdiagnose conditions, as seen in the case of Phineas Gage.
- **Neurophysiology** — understanding how the brain functions is crucial for developing effective treatments, and the lack of this knowledge hindered the development of treatments for epilepsy, such as the ketogenic diet, which was initially met with skepticism due to limited understanding of brain function.
- **Pharmacology** — knowledge of how medications interact with the brain is necessary to develop effective treatments, and the absence of this knowledge led to the development of medications with severe side effects, such as the antipsychotic drug Thorazine, which was later found to have severe neurological side effects.
- **Psychology** — understanding the psychological aspects of neurological disorders is necessary to develop effective treatments, and the lack of this knowledge led to the development of ineffective treatments for conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which was initially treated with ineffective therapies such as psychoanalysis.
- **Imaging technologies** — such as MRI and CT scans, are necessary to diagnose and monitor neurological disorders, and the absence of these technologies would make it difficult to diagnose conditions such as stroke and brain tumors, as seen in the case of the singer Sheryl Crow, who was diagnosed with a brain tumor after undergoing an MRI scan.
- **Genetics** — understanding the genetic basis of neurological disorders is necessary to develop effective treatments, and the lack of this knowledge hindered the development of treatments for conditions such as Huntington's disease, which is caused by a genetic mutation.

## Priority Order
The dependencies can be ranked in the following order:
- **Neuroanatomy**, as it is the foundation of neurology and all other dependencies rely on it
- **Neurophysiology**, as it is necessary to understand how the brain functions in order to develop effective treatments
- **Pharmacology**, as it is necessary to understand how medications interact with the brain in order to develop effective treatments
- **Imaging technologies**, as they are necessary to diagnose and monitor neurological disorders
- **Psychology**, as it is necessary to understand the psychological aspects of neurological disorders, but it is not as critical as the other dependencies
- **Genetics**, as it is necessary to understand the genetic basis of neurological disorders, but it is not as critical as the other dependencies, and it is a relatively new field of study.

## Common Gaps
People often overlook the importance of **interdisciplinary collaboration**, assuming that neurologists can work in isolation to diagnose and treat neurological disorders, but this assumption can lead to ineffective treatments and misdiagnoses, as seen in the case of the writer and philosopher Jean-Dominique Bauby, who was diagnosed with a condition called locked-in syndrome and was unable to communicate effectively with his doctors due to a lack of interdisciplinary collaboration.
