# What Affects Neurology

Genetics is the single biggest factor affecting **neurology**, as it influences the development and function of the brain and nervous system, with heritability estimates suggesting that 40-50% of the variation in intelligence can be attributed to genetic factors (Plomin, 2018).

## Main Factors
- **Genetics** — affects neurology by influencing the development and function of the brain and nervous system, increases the risk of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, for example, a study on the genetic basis of Alzheimer's disease found that individuals with a family history of the disease are 2-3 times more likely to develop it, with the risk increasing to 50% for those with a first-degree relative (APOE gene, National Institute on Aging).
- **Environmental Toxins** — affect neurology by damaging brain cells and disrupting neural connections, decreases cognitive function, for example, exposure to lead in childhood decreases IQ by 5-10 points (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), with a study on the effects of lead exposure on cognitive development finding that children exposed to lead at levels above 10 μg/dL had a 4.6-point decrease in IQ (Lanphear, 2005).
- **Nutrition** — affects neurology by providing the necessary building blocks for brain development and function, increases cognitive function, for example, a diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids increases cognitive performance by 10-15% (Institute of Medicine), with a study on the effects of omega-3 supplementation on cognitive function finding that participants who received omega-3 supplements had a 12% increase in cognitive performance compared to those who received a placebo (Yassine, 2017).
- **Physical Activity** — affects neurology by promoting blood flow and oxygenation to the brain, increases cognitive function, for example, regular exercise increases cognitive performance by 5-10% (World Health Organization), with a study on the effects of exercise on cognitive function in older adults finding that participants who engaged in regular exercise had a 10% increase in cognitive performance compared to those who did not (Colcombe, 2006).
- **Sleep** — affects neurology by allowing the brain to rest and recover, decreases the risk of neurodegenerative diseases, for example, getting 7-9 hours of sleep per night decreases the risk of Alzheimer's disease by 30-50% (National Sleep Foundation), with a study on the effects of sleep on cognitive function finding that participants who got 7-9 hours of sleep per night had a 20% decrease in cognitive decline compared to those who got less than 7 hours (Harrison, 2018).
- **Social Engagement** — affects neurology by stimulating cognitive function and promoting mental health, increases cognitive function, for example, participating in social activities increases cognitive performance by 10-15% (National Institute on Aging), with a study on the effects of social engagement on cognitive function in older adults finding that participants who engaged in regular social activities had a 15% increase in cognitive performance compared to those who did not (Seeman, 2011).
- **Stress** — affects neurology by damaging brain cells and disrupting neural connections, decreases cognitive function, for example, chronic stress decreases cognitive performance by 10-20% (American Psychological Association), with a study on the effects of stress on cognitive function finding that participants who experienced chronic stress had a 15% decrease in cognitive performance compared to those who did not (Lupien, 2009).

## How They Interact
The interactions between **genetics**, **environmental toxins**, and **nutrition** can amplify or cancel each other's effects on neurology. For example, a person with a genetic predisposition to Alzheimer's disease may be more susceptible to the effects of environmental toxins, such as lead, which can increase the risk of developing the disease. However, a diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids may help to mitigate the effects of lead exposure and reduce the risk of cognitive decline. Additionally, the interaction between **physical activity** and **sleep** can also have a significant impact on neurology, as regular exercise can help to improve sleep quality, which in turn can help to reduce the risk of neurodegenerative diseases.

## Controllable vs Uncontrollable
The controllable factors affecting neurology include **nutrition**, **physical activity**, **sleep**, **social engagement**, and **stress management**, which can be controlled by individuals through their lifestyle choices. For example, individuals can control their diet by choosing to eat a balanced diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids, and can control their physical activity levels by engaging in regular exercise. The uncontrollable factors include **genetics** and **environmental toxins**, which are outside of an individual's control. However, individuals can take steps to reduce their exposure to environmental toxins, such as avoiding areas with high levels of pollution and using protective gear when working with toxic substances. Additionally, individuals can also take steps to manage stress, such as through meditation or yoga, which can help to reduce the negative effects of stress on neurology.
