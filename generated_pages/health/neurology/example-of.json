  "content": "## Definition\nNeurology is the branch of medicine that deals with the diagnosis, treatment, and management of disorders and diseases affecting the nervous system, which was first described by Thomas Willis in 1664.\n\n## How It Works\nThe nervous system is a complex network of specialized cells, tissues, and organs that work together to control and coordinate the body's functions, with the brain and spinal cord serving as the central and peripheral nervous systems, respectively. The **neurotransmitter** dopamine, for example, plays a crucial role in regulating movement and emotion, with deficiencies in dopamine associated with conditions such as Parkinson's disease. According to Ricardo's framework of neural communication, the release and binding of neurotransmitters to receptors on adjacent neurons facilitate the transmission of electrical and chemical signals throughout the nervous system.\n\nThe **blood-brain barrier**, a specialized network of blood vessels and cells, regulates the flow of nutrients, hormones, and other substances into and out of the brain, with a surface area of approximately 12-15 square meters (National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke). The **cerebrospinal fluid**, produced at a rate of about 500 milliliters per day (Guyton and Hall), circulates through the ventricles and subarachnoid space, providing mechanical and immunological protection to the brain and spinal cord. Neurologists use a range of diagnostic tools, including **electroencephalography** (EEG) and **magnetic resonance imaging** (MRI), to visualize and analyze the structure and function of the nervous system.\n\nNeurological disorders, such as stroke and traumatic brain injury, can result from damage to the nervous system, with the World Health Organization estimating that approximately 50 million people worldwide suffer from epilepsy (World Health Organization). The **neuroplasticity** of the brain, its ability to reorganize and adapt in response to injury or experience, is a key factor in recovery from neurological disorders, with research by Hebb and others demonstrating the importance of **synaptic pruning** and **neurogenesis** in maintaining cognitive function.\n\n## Key Components\n- **Neurons**: specialized cells that transmit and process information through electrical and chemical signals, with an estimated 86 billion neurons in the human brain (Herculano-Houzel)\n- **Glia**: non-neuronal cells that provide support, nutrition, and maintenance functions for neurons, with **astrocytes** and **oligodendrocytes** playing key roles in regulating the extracellular environment\n- **Synapses**: specialized structures that facilitate the transmission of signals between neurons, with **long-term potentiation** and **long-term depression** mediating learning and memory\n- **Neurotransmitters**: chemical messengers that transmit signals between neurons, with **serotonin** and **acetylcholine** involved in regulating mood and cognitive function\n- **Cerebral vasculature**: the network of blood vessels that supply oxygen and nutrients to the brain, with **cerebral blood flow** regulated by **autoregulation** and **neurogenic control**\n\n## Common Misconceptions\n**Myth:** Neurological disorders are rare and affect only a small percentage of the population \u2014 **Fact:** Neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, affect millions of people worldwide, with the World Health Organization estimating that approximately 1 billion people suffer from neurological disorders (World Health Organization). \n**Myth:** The brain is fully developed at birth \u2014 **Fact:** The brain continues to develop and mature throughout childhood and adolescence, with **synaptic pruning** and **myelination** refining neural connections and improving cognitive function (Huttenlocher). \n**Myth:** Neurological disorders are always caused by genetics \u2014 **Fact:** While genetic factors can contribute to neurological disorders, environmental and lifestyle factors, such as **head trauma** and **infection**, can also play a significant role (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).\n\n## In Practice\nThe treatment of neurological disorders, such as stroke and traumatic brain injury, requires a multidisciplinary approach, with neurologists, neurosurgeons, and rehabilitation specialists working together to provide comprehensive care. At the University of California, San Francisco, for example, the **Neurological Surgery Residency Program** provides training in the diagnosis, treatment, and management of neurological disorders, with residents participating in approximately 1,500 surgical procedures annually (University of California, San Francisco). The **National Institutes of Health** provides funding for research into neurological disorders, with approximately $1.5 billion allocated annually for research into neurological diseases and disorders (National Institutes of Health).",
