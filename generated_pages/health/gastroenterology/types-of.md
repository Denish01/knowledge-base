# Types of Gastroenterology

There are five main categories of gastroenterology, organized by the specific area of the digestive system they focus on. 
## Main Categories
Gastroenterology encompasses several specialized fields, each focusing on distinct aspects of the digestive system. 
- **Pediatric Gastroenterology** — focuses on digestive issues in children, such as celiac disease, with distinguishing characteristics including the need for specialized equipment and age-specific treatment protocols, as seen in the work of the **Children's Hospital of Philadelphia**.
- **Hepatology** — concerns the liver, pancreas, and gallbladder, with characteristics including the diagnosis and treatment of liver diseases like hepatitis, as exemplified by the **Liver Disease Research Branch** at the National Institutes of Health.
- **Gastrointestinal Oncology** — deals with cancers of the digestive system, such as colorectal cancer, with characteristics including multidisciplinary treatment approaches and participation in clinical trials, as demonstrated by the **University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center**.
- **Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) Gastroenterology** — specializes in chronic conditions like Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, with characteristics including the use of immunosuppressive medications and surgical interventions, as seen in the practice of **Dr. Stephen Hanauer** at Northwestern University.
- **Transplant Hepatology** — involves the evaluation and care of patients undergoing liver transplantation, with characteristics including pre-transplant evaluation and post-transplant management, as performed by the **Liver Transplant Program** at the University of California, San Francisco.

## Comparison Table
| Category | Focus | Treatment Approach | Patient Population |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Pediatric Gastroenterology | Digestive issues in children | Age-specific treatment protocols | Children under 18 |
| Hepatology | Liver, pancreas, and gallbladder diseases | Medication, surgery, or transplant | Adults and children with liver disease |
| Gastrointestinal Oncology | Cancers of the digestive system | Surgery, chemotherapy, radiation | Adults with digestive system cancers |
| Inflammatory Bowel Disease Gastroenterology | Chronic IBD conditions | Immunomodulators, biologics, surgery | Adults and children with IBD |
| Transplant Hepatology | Liver transplantation | Pre-transplant evaluation, post-transplant management | Adults and children requiring liver transplant |

## How They Relate
These categories often overlap, with hepatology and transplant hepatology frequently intersecting in the care of patients with advanced liver disease, such as those requiring liver transplantation due to **cirrhosis**. Pediatric gastroenterology may also intersect with IBD gastroenterology, as children with IBD require specialized care and treatment. Gastrointestinal oncology may involve collaboration with hepatology and transplant hepatology in the management of liver cancers, such as **hepatocellular carcinoma**. The specific pair of hepatology and transplant hepatology is commonly confused due to their closely related focus areas, but they are distinct in their treatment approaches and patient populations.
