# Common Misconceptions About Gastroenterology

The most common misconception in gastroenterology is that **antacids** can cure gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), when in fact, they only provide temporary relief for mild symptoms, as evidenced by the 2.5-fold increased risk of osteoporosis associated with long-term proton pump inhibitor use (FDA warnings).

## Misconceptions
- **Myth:** Eating spicy food causes stomach ulcers.
- **Fact:** The majority of stomach ulcers are caused by **Helicobacter pylori** infection or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use, with a reported 60% of gastric ulcers attributed to H. pylori (Marshall and Warren, 1984).
- **Source of confusion:** This myth persists due to the common misconception that stomach ulcers are caused by stress and spicy food, a narrative perpetuated by media and popular culture.
- **Myth:** Lactose intolerance is rare in people of European descent.
- **Fact:** Approximately 5% of people of European descent are lactose intolerant, with lactose intolerance affecting up to 65% of people worldwide (Swallow et al., 2001).
- **Source of confusion:** The myth that lactose intolerance is rare in Europeans may stem from the fact that many Europeans have a genetic adaptation that allows them to digest lactose into adulthood, leading to a lower reported incidence.
- **Myth:** Fiber supplements can cure irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
- **Fact:** While a high-fiber diet may help alleviate some IBS symptoms, fiber supplements have been shown to have limited efficacy in treating the condition, with a recent review finding that only 10% of IBS patients responded to fiber therapy (Muller-Lissner et al., 2018).
- **Source of confusion:** The widespread promotion of fiber supplements as a cure-all for digestive issues has contributed to this misconception.
- **Myth:** Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is caused by excess stomach acid.
- **Fact:** GERD is often caused by a weakened lower esophageal sphincter, which allows stomach acid to flow back into the esophagus, with a study finding that 75% of GERD patients had normal or low stomach acid levels (Katz et al., 2013).
- **Source of confusion:** The myth that GERD is caused by excess stomach acid may have originated from the fact that antacids and proton pump inhibitors, which reduce stomach acid, can provide temporary relief from symptoms.
- **Myth:** Celiac disease is a rare condition.
- **Fact:** Celiac disease affects approximately 1 in 100 people worldwide, with a reported prevalence of 0.5-1.3% in the United States (Fasano et al., 2003).
- **Source of confusion:** The myth that celiac disease is rare may be due to the fact that it was previously underdiagnosed, with many cases being misattributed to other conditions.

## Quick Reference
- **Myth:** Antacids cure GERD → **Fact:** Antacids provide temporary relief, but do not address underlying causes (FDA warnings)
- **Myth:** Spicy food causes stomach ulcers → **Fact:** H. pylori and NSAIDs are primary causes of stomach ulcers (Marshall and Warren, 1984)
- **Myth:** Lactose intolerance is rare in Europeans → **Fact:** 5% of Europeans are lactose intolerant (Swallow et al., 2001)
- **Myth:** Fiber supplements cure IBS → **Fact:** Fiber supplements have limited efficacy in treating IBS (Muller-Lissner et al., 2018)
- **Myth:** GERD is caused by excess stomach acid → **Fact:** Weakened lower esophageal sphincter is a primary cause of GERD (Katz et al., 2013)
- **Myth:** Celiac disease is rare → **Fact:** Celiac disease affects approximately 1 in 100 people worldwide (Fasano et al., 2003)
