  "content": "Gastroenterology is the branch of medicine that focuses on the **digestive system**, which breaks down food into nutrients that can be absorbed by the body, with the small intestine absorbing approximately 90% of nutrients (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases).\n\n## The Mechanism\nThe core cause-and-effect chain in gastroenterology involves the **mouth**, **esophagus**, **stomach**, **small intestine**, and **large intestine** working together to break down food into nutrients that can be absorbed by the body. The process begins with **mechanical digestion** in the mouth, where food is chewed into smaller pieces, and ends with **absorption** in the small intestine, where nutrients are absorbed into the bloodstream.\n\n## Step-by-Step\n1. **Ingestion** occurs when food enters the mouth, where it is chewed into smaller pieces by **teeth** and mixed with **saliva** that contains **enzymes** such as **amylase**, which breaks down carbohydrates into simpler sugars, producing a bolus that is approximately 1-2 cm in diameter.\n2. **Swallowing** occurs when the bolus is propelled into the esophagus by **peristalsis**, a wave-like muscle contraction that moves food down the esophagus at a rate of approximately 3-4 cm/s, resulting in the bolus entering the stomach in about 5-10 seconds.\n3. **Gastric digestion** occurs in the stomach, where the bolus is mixed with **gastric juice** that contains **pepsin**, an enzyme that breaks down proteins into smaller peptides, producing a mixture that has a pH of approximately 1.5-2.5, which is acidic enough to denature proteins.\n4. **Small intestine digestion** occurs when the partially digested food enters the small intestine, where it is mixed with **pancreatic juice** that contains **amylase**, **lipase**, and **trypsin**, enzymes that break down carbohydrates, fats, and proteins into simpler sugars, fatty acids, and amino acids, resulting in the absorption of approximately 90% of nutrients.\n5. **Large intestine digestion** occurs when the remaining waste products enter the large intestine, where **water** and **electrolytes** are absorbed, resulting in the formation of **feces** that are approximately 75% water.\n6. **Defecation** occurs when the feces are eliminated from the body through the **anus**, resulting in the removal of approximately 100-200 grams of waste per day.\n\n## Key Components\n- **Mouth**: responsible for mechanical digestion, where food is chewed into smaller pieces, and **saliva** is produced, which contains **enzymes** that break down carbohydrates.\n- **Esophagus**: responsible for propelling food into the stomach through **peristalsis**, a wave-like muscle contraction.\n- **Stomach**: responsible for **gastric digestion**, where food is mixed with **gastric juice** that contains **pepsin**, an enzyme that breaks down proteins.\n- **Small intestine**: responsible for **small intestine digestion**, where food is mixed with **pancreatic juice** that contains **amylase**, **lipase**, and **trypsin**, enzymes that break down carbohydrates, fats, and proteins.\n- **Large intestine**: responsible for **water** and **electrolyte** absorption, resulting in the formation of **feces**.\n\n## Common Questions\nWhat happens if the **stomach** is removed? The **small intestine** can still absorb nutrients, but the **digestion** process may be less efficient, resulting in **malabsorption** of nutrients. \nWhat is the function of **saliva** in digestion? **Saliva** contains **enzymes** such as **amylase** that break down carbohydrates into simpler sugars, facilitating **mechanical digestion**. \nWhat happens if the **large intestine** is blocked? **Feces** can accumulate in the **large intestine**, resulting in **constipation** or **obstruction**, which can lead to **nausea**, **vomiting**, and **abdominal pain**. \nWhat is the role of **pancreatic juice** in digestion? **Pancreatic juice** contains **amylase**, **lipase**, and **trypsin**, enzymes that break down carbohydrates, fats, and proteins into simpler sugars, fatty acids, and amino acids, facilitating **small intestine digestion**.",
