  "content": "There are two main categories of circulatory systems, which are distinguished by the presence or absence of a closed network of blood vessels, and are further subdivided into several subcategories based on their structure and function. \n## Main Categories\n- **Open Circulatory System** \u2014 characterized by the absence of a closed network of blood vessels, with blood bathing organs directly, as seen in the **grasshopper**, which has a large internal cavity called a hemocoel that contains blood and surrounds its organs.\n- **Closed Circulatory System** \u2014 defined by the presence of a closed network of blood vessels, with blood confined to blood vessels and transported to tissues via capillaries, as exemplified by the **human**, which has a complex network of arteries, veins, and capillaries that supply oxygen and nutrients to its tissues.\n- **Semi-Closed Circulatory System** \u2014 a hybrid system that combines elements of open and closed circulatory systems, with blood vessels present in some areas but not others, as found in the **earthworm**, which has a closed system of blood vessels in its pharynx and brain but an open system in its body wall.\n- **Gill Circulatory System** \u2014 a specialized system found in aquatic animals, where blood is pumped to gills for oxygenation before being distributed to the rest of the body, as seen in the **salmon**, which has a complex system of blood vessels that supply oxygen to its gills and body tissues.\n\n## Comparison Table\n| Category | Complexity | Oxygen Delivery Efficiency | Example Organism |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Open Circulatory System | Low | Low | Grasshopper |\n| Closed Circulatory System | High | High | Human |\n| Semi-Closed Circulatory System | Medium | Medium | Earthworm |\n| Gill Circulatory System | High | High | Salmon |\n\n## How They Relate\nThe categories of circulatory systems are not mutually exclusive, and some organisms exhibit characteristics of multiple categories, such as the **hagfish**, which has a closed circulatory system but also has a network of blood vessels that resemble an open system. The **octopus** has a closed circulatory system with a complex network of blood vessels, but its gills are also supplied with oxygen via a specialized circulatory system. The **frog** has a semi-closed circulatory system, with a closed system in its lungs and an open system in its skin, highlighting the diversity and complexity of circulatory systems in different organisms.",
