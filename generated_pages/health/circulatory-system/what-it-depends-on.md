# What Circulatory System Depends On

The circulatory system depends on **oxygen supply** from the respiratory system to function properly, as seen in cases of respiratory failure where patients experience severe hypoxia, leading to cardiac arrest, such as the 1979 case of a patient who died from cardiac arrest due to respiratory failure (American Heart Association).

## Key Dependencies
- **Oxygen supply** — the circulatory system relies on a constant supply of oxygen from the respiratory system to maintain cellular metabolism and energy production, and without it, cells quickly become hypoxic, leading to tissue damage and organ failure, as in the case of a patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who experienced cardiac arrest due to severe hypoxia (National Institutes of Health).
- **Blood composition** — the circulatory system requires a precise balance of blood components, including red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, and plasma, to maintain proper blood viscosity, oxygen transport, and immune function, and an imbalance can lead to conditions such as anemia, which affects over 1.6 billion people worldwide (World Health Organization), and can cause fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath.
- **Vascular integrity** — the circulatory system relies on a network of blood vessels, including arteries, veins, and capillaries, to transport blood throughout the body, and damage to these vessels can lead to conditions such as atherosclerosis, which affects over 15 million people in the United States (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), and can cause heart attacks, strokes, and other cardiovascular events.
- **Cardiac function** — the circulatory system depends on the heart to pump blood throughout the body, and cardiac dysfunction can lead to conditions such as heart failure, which affects over 6 million people in the United States (American Heart Association), and can cause fatigue, swelling, and shortness of breath.
- **Neurological regulation** — the circulatory system is regulated by the nervous system, which controls heart rate, blood pressure, and vascular tone, and neurological disorders such as autonomic nervous system dysfunction can lead to conditions such as orthostatic hypotension, which affects over 30% of older adults (National Institute on Aging), and can cause dizziness, lightheadedness, and fainting.

## Priority Order
The dependencies can be ranked in order of priority as follows:
- **Oxygen supply** — this is the most critical dependency, as the circulatory system cannot function without a constant supply of oxygen, and even brief periods of hypoxia can cause irreversible damage.
- **Cardiac function** — this is the second most critical dependency, as the heart is responsible for pumping blood throughout the body, and cardiac dysfunction can lead to rapid deterioration of circulatory function.
- **Vascular integrity** — this is the third most critical dependency, as damage to blood vessels can lead to conditions such as atherosclerosis, which can cause cardiovascular events.
- **Blood composition** — this is the fourth most critical dependency, as an imbalance of blood components can lead to conditions such as anemia, but the body has some ability to compensate for these imbalances.
- **Neurological regulation** — this is the least critical dependency, as the circulatory system can still function with some degree of neurological dysfunction, although this can lead to conditions such as orthostatic hypotension.

## Common Gaps
People often overlook the importance of **physical activity** in maintaining circulatory health, assuming that a sedentary lifestyle has no significant effects on the circulatory system, but this can lead to conditions such as cardiovascular disease, which affects over 121 million people in the United States (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), and can cause heart attacks, strokes, and other cardiovascular events.
