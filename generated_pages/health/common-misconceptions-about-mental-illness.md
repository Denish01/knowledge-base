It is essential to understand the facts about mental illness to promote awareness, empathy, and inclusivity.

2. MISCONCEPTION LIST: 
Here are some common myths about mental illness:
- Myth: People with mental illnesses are violent and dangerous.
  Reality: The majority of people with mental illnesses are not violent and are more likely to be victims of crime than perpetrators.

- Myth: Mental illness is a sign of weakness.
  Reality: Mental illness is a medical condition that can affect anyone, regardless of their strength or resilience.
  Why people believe this: This myth may stem from the idea that individuals with mental illnesses are somehow flawed or lacking in character, rather than recognizing that mental illness is a treatable condition that requires medical attention.
