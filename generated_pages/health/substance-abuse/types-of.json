  "content": "There are seven primary categories of substance abuse, organized by the type of substance being abused. \n## Main Categories\n- **Alcohol Abuse** \u2014 characterized by excessive consumption of alcoholic beverages, often leading to impaired judgment and physical dependence, as seen in the case of **John Daly**, a professional golfer who has publicly struggled with alcoholism.\n- **Opioid Abuse** \u2014 involves the misuse of prescription painkillers or illegal opioids, such as heroin, which can lead to severe physical dependence and overdose, as exemplified by the **Sackler family**, whose company Purdue Pharma has faced intense scrutiny for its role in the opioid crisis.\n- **Cocaine Abuse** \u2014 marked by the recreational use of cocaine, a powerful stimulant that can cause cardiovascular problems and aggressive behavior, as illustrated by the case of **Robbie Williams**, a singer who has spoken publicly about his past struggles with cocaine addiction.\n- **Cannabis Abuse** \u2014 characterized by the excessive use of marijuana, which can lead to cognitive impairment and increased risk of mental health problems, as seen in the case of **Snoop Dogg**, a rapper who has been open about his heavy marijuana use.\n- **Tobacco Abuse** \u2014 involves the misuse of nicotine-containing products, such as cigarettes and e-cigarettes, which can lead to nicotine addiction and increased risk of respiratory diseases, as exemplified by the ** Marlboro Man**, a iconic advertising figure who has been linked to the promotion of cigarette smoking.\n- **Prescription Stimulant Abuse** \u2014 characterized by the misuse of prescription medications, such as Adderall and Ritalin, which can lead to physical dependence and cardiovascular problems, as seen in the case of **Eminem**, a rapper who has spoken publicly about his past struggles with prescription pill addiction.\n- **Hallucinogen Abuse** \u2014 involves the use of substances that alter perception and mood, such as LSD and psilocybin, which can lead to severe psychological distress and increased risk of mental health problems, as illustrated by the case of **Aldous Huxley**, an author who wrote extensively about his experiences with hallucinogenic substances.\n\n## Comparison Table\n| Category | Cost | Scale | Risk |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Alcohol Abuse | moderate to high (~$50-100 per week) | widespread (~30% of adults) | high (increased risk of liver disease and accidents) |\n| Opioid Abuse | high (~$100-500 per week) | moderate (~2% of adults) | extremely high (increased risk of overdose and death) |\n| Cocaine Abuse | high (~$100-500 per week) | moderate (~1% of adults) | extremely high (increased risk of cardiovascular problems and overdose) |\n| Cannabis Abuse | low to moderate (~$20-50 per week) | widespread (~10% of adults) | moderate (increased risk of cognitive impairment and mental health problems) |\n| Tobacco Abuse | moderate (~$50-100 per week) | widespread (~20% of adults) | high (increased risk of respiratory diseases and cancer) |\n| Prescription Stimulant Abuse | moderate (~$20-50 per week) | moderate (~5% of adults) | high (increased risk of physical dependence and cardiovascular problems) |\n| Hallucinogen Abuse | low to moderate (~$10-30 per week) | limited (~1% of adults) | high (increased risk of psychological distress and mental health problems) |\n\n## How They Relate\nThe categories of substance abuse often overlap, with individuals frequently misusing multiple substances. For example, **alcohol and tobacco abuse** often co-occur, as both substances are commonly used in social settings and can exacerbate each other's negative effects. **Opioid and prescription stimulant abuse** can also be linked, as individuals may be prescribed opioid painkillers and then become dependent on them, leading to the misuse of prescription stimulants as a substitute. Additionally, **cannabis and hallucinogen abuse** can be related, as both substances can alter perception and mood, and individuals may use them in combination to enhance their effects. Understanding these relationships is critical for developing effective treatment strategies and preventing substance abuse.",
