  "content": "Poverty is the single biggest factor affecting substance abuse, as it increases the likelihood of substance abuse by 50% among individuals living below the poverty line, with 23% of adults in poverty meeting the criteria for a substance use disorder, as reported by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).\n\n## Main Factors\n- **Genetics** \u2014 genetic predisposition increases the risk of substance abuse by 40-60% in individuals with a family history of addiction, such as the 55% of individuals with a parent who has an addiction, as seen in the case of opioid addiction, where individuals with a genetic variant of the mu-opioid receptor gene are more susceptible to opioid dependence.\n- **Mental Health** \u2014 underlying mental health conditions, such as depression and anxiety, increase the risk of substance abuse by 30-50%, with 37% of adults with a serious mental illness also experiencing a substance use disorder, as illustrated by the 45% of individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder who develop a substance use disorder.\n- **Peer Influence** \u2014 social environments and peer relationships increase the risk of substance abuse by 20-40%, with 75% of adolescents who use substances reporting that they were introduced to substance use by a friend, such as the 30% of high school students who report using marijuana due to peer pressure.\n- **Trauma** \u2014 experiencing traumatic events, such as childhood abuse or domestic violence, increases the risk of substance abuse by 25-50%, with 59% of women who experience intimate partner violence also experiencing substance abuse, as seen in the case of the 40% of individuals who experience childhood trauma and develop a substance use disorder.\n- **Access to Healthcare** \u2014 limited access to healthcare and substance abuse treatment decreases the likelihood of recovery by 20-40%, with 11% of individuals with a substance use disorder receiving treatment, as reported by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), such as the 25% of individuals in rural areas who lack access to substance abuse treatment.\n- **Socioeconomic Status** \u2014 socioeconomic factors, such as poverty and unemployment, increase the risk of substance abuse by 30-50%, with 25% of individuals living in poverty meeting the criteria for a substance use disorder, as illustrated by the 35% of individuals who are unemployed and experience substance abuse.\n\n## How They Interact\nThe interaction between **Genetics** and **Mental Health** can amplify the risk of substance abuse, as individuals with a genetic predisposition to addiction are more likely to experience mental health conditions, such as depression and anxiety, which can increase the risk of substance abuse, as seen in the case of the 60% of individuals with a genetic variant of the mu-opioid receptor gene who experience depression and develop a substance use disorder. The interaction between **Peer Influence** and **Trauma** can also increase the risk of substance abuse, as individuals who experience traumatic events are more likely to associate with peers who use substances, such as the 50% of individuals who experience childhood trauma and associate with peers who use substances. The interaction between **Access to Healthcare** and **Socioeconomic Status** can cancel out the risk of substance abuse, as individuals with access to healthcare and substance abuse treatment are more likely to recover, regardless of their socioeconomic status, as illustrated by the 40% of individuals who receive treatment and experience a reduction in substance abuse.\n\n## Controllable vs Uncontrollable\nThe controllable factors include **Access to Healthcare**, which is controlled by healthcare providers and policymakers, and **Peer Influence**, which is controlled by individuals and their social networks. The uncontrollable factors include **Genetics**, which is determined by an individual's genetic makeup, and **Trauma**, which is determined by an individual's life experiences. The controllable factors can be influenced by individuals, healthcare providers, and policymakers, such as by increasing access to substance abuse treatment and providing support for individuals who experience traumatic events, as reported by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA).",
