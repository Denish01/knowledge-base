  "content": "There are five main categories of mental illness, which can be organized based on their primary symptoms and characteristics. \n## Main Categories\n- **Mood Disorders** \u2014 characterized by disturbances in emotional states, such as depression or mania, with a notable example being **Major Depressive Disorder**, which affects individuals like actress Emma Thompson.\n- **Anxiety Disorders** \u2014 marked by excessive fear or anxiety, with **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)** being a prominent example, as seen in the case of former US Senator Tammy Duckworth.\n- **Psychotic Disorders** \u2014 involving a disconnection from reality, with **Schizophrenia** being a well-known example, as experienced by mathematician John Nash.\n- **Personality Disorders** \u2014 characterized by enduring patterns of inner experience and behavior that deviate from cultural norms, with **Borderline Personality Disorder** being a notable example, as seen in the life of actress Britney Spears.\n- **Trauma and Stressor-Related Disorders** \u2014 resulting from exposure to traumatic events, with **Acute Stress Disorder** being an example, as experienced by survivors of the 9/11 attacks.\n\n## Comparison Table\n| Category | Primary Symptoms | Treatment Options | Risk Factors |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Mood Disorders | Emotional disturbances | Medication, therapy | Family history, brain chemistry |\n| Anxiety Disorders | Excessive fear or anxiety | Therapy, medication | Genetics, life experiences |\n| Psychotic Disorders | Disconnection from reality | Medication, therapy | Family history, substance abuse |\n| Personality Disorders | Enduring behavior patterns | Therapy, medication | Childhood experiences, genetics |\n| Trauma and Stressor-Related Disorders | Trauma responses | Therapy, medication | Traumatic events, genetics |\n\n## How They Relate\nMood Disorders and Anxiety Disorders often overlap, as individuals with **Major Depressive Disorder** may also experience **Generalized Anxiety Disorder**. Psychotic Disorders, such as **Schizophrenia**, can be confused with Mood Disorders, but are distinct due to their characteristic disconnection from reality. Personality Disorders, like **Borderline Personality Disorder**, can increase the risk of developing Mood Disorders or Anxiety Disorders. Trauma and Stressor-Related Disorders, such as **Acute Stress Disorder**, can be a precursor to the development of other mental health conditions, like **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder**. Additionally, individuals with a history of **Substance Abuse** are at higher risk of developing Psychotic Disorders or Mood Disorders. The **Diathesis-Stress Model** suggests that mental illnesses result from the interaction between genetic predispositions and environmental stressors, highlighting the complex relationships between these categories.",
