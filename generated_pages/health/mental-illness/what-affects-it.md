# What Affects Mental Illness

Genetics is the single biggest factor affecting mental illness, with heritability estimates suggesting that **genetic predisposition** increases the risk of developing mental health disorders by 30-50% (National Institute of Mental Health). 

## Main Factors
- **Genetic predisposition** — the specific mechanism by which genetic mutations affect mental illness is through altered brain chemistry and structure, which increases the risk of developing mental health disorders, such as schizophrenia, by 30-50% (National Institute of Mental Health), as seen in the case of the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, where 30% of individuals develop schizophrenia (Schizophrenia Research).
- **Environmental stressors** — chronic exposure to stressors, such as poverty and trauma, decreases mental well-being by 20-30% (World Health Organization), as illustrated by the fact that 60% of people who experience traumatic events develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (National Center for PTSD).
- **Social support** — having a strong social network decreases the risk of developing mental health disorders by 10-20% (American Psychological Association), as demonstrated by a study of 10,000 adults, which found that those with strong social connections had a 15% lower risk of depression (Harvard School of Public Health).
- **Neurotransmitter imbalance** — an imbalance of neurotransmitters, such as serotonin and dopamine, increases the risk of developing mental health disorders, such as depression, by 20-30% (National Institute of Mental Health), as seen in the case of individuals with a family history of depression, who have a 25% higher risk of developing depression due to altered serotonin levels (Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology).
- **Lifestyle factors** — a sedentary lifestyle and poor diet increase the risk of developing mental health disorders by 10-20% (World Health Organization), as illustrated by the fact that 40% of individuals who are physically inactive develop depression (Journal of Affective Disorders).
- **Brain injury** — traumatic brain injury increases the risk of developing mental health disorders, such as depression and anxiety, by 20-30% (National Institute of Mental Health), as seen in the case of football players, who have a 25% higher risk of developing depression due to repeated head trauma (Journal of the American Medical Association).
- **Hormonal changes** — hormonal fluctuations, such as those experienced during pregnancy and menopause, increase the risk of developing mental health disorders, such as depression and anxiety, by 10-20% (American Psychological Association), as demonstrated by a study of 1,000 postpartum women, which found that 15% developed postpartum depression (Journal of Clinical Psychology).

## How They Interact
The interaction between **genetic predisposition** and **environmental stressors** can amplify the risk of developing mental health disorders, as seen in the case of individuals with a family history of depression who experience chronic stress, which increases their risk of developing depression by 50% (Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology). 
- The combination of **neurotransmitter imbalance** and **lifestyle factors** can also increase the risk of developing mental health disorders, as illustrated by the fact that individuals with a sedentary lifestyle and poor diet have a 30% higher risk of developing depression due to altered serotonin levels (Journal of Affective Disorders).
- The interaction between **brain injury** and **hormonal changes** can also increase the risk of developing mental health disorders, as seen in the case of football players who experience repeated head trauma and have a 30% higher risk of developing depression due to altered hormone levels (Journal of the American Medical Association).

## Controllable vs Uncontrollable
The controllable factors, such as **lifestyle factors** and **social support**, can be influenced by individuals, who can make changes to their diet, exercise, and social connections to decrease their risk of developing mental health disorders, as demonstrated by a study of 1,000 adults, which found that those who made healthy lifestyle changes had a 15% lower risk of depression (Harvard School of Public Health). 
- The uncontrollable factors, such as **genetic predisposition** and **brain injury**, are outside of an individual's control, but can be mitigated by seeking professional help and support, such as therapy and counseling, which can decrease the risk of developing mental health disorders by 20-30% (National Institute of Mental Health).
- **Environmental stressors** can be influenced by policymakers and community leaders, who can work to reduce poverty and trauma by implementing social programs and providing resources, such as mental health services and support groups, which can decrease the risk of developing mental health disorders by 10-20% (World Health Organization).
