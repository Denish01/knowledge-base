  "content": "Stable **family relationships** are the most critical dependency for preventing mental illness, as their absence can lead to increased stress, anxiety, and depression, as seen in the case of foster children who experience frequent changes in caregivers, resulting in higher rates of mental health issues (American Academy of Pediatrics).\n\n## Key Dependencies\n- **Social support networks** \u2014 a lack of social connections can exacerbate mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety, as evidenced by the increased suicide rates among elderly individuals who live alone, with 43% of seniors reporting feelings of loneliness (National Council on Aging).\n- **Access to healthcare** \u2014 inadequate healthcare can lead to untreated mental health conditions, such as the case of the mental health crisis in rural Appalachia, where limited access to healthcare services has resulted in higher rates of depression and substance abuse (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration).\n- **Nutrition and diet** \u2014 a poor diet can contribute to mental health issues, such as the correlation between a diet high in processed foods and increased symptoms of depression, as seen in a study of individuals with major depressive disorder who experienced improved symptoms after switching to a Mediterranean-style diet (Harvard School of Public Health).\n- **Sleep and relaxation** \u2014 inadequate sleep and relaxation can worsen mental health conditions, such as the case of individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) who experience increased symptoms of anxiety and depression due to sleep disturbances (National Center for PTSD).\n- **Cognitive-behavioral therapy** \u2014 a lack of access to evidence-based therapies can hinder recovery from mental illness, as seen in the case of individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) who experience improved symptoms after receiving cognitive-behavioral therapy (International OCD Foundation).\n\n## Priority Order\nThe priority order of these dependencies is as follows:\n- **Family relationships**, as they provide a foundation for social support and emotional stability.\n- **Access to healthcare**, as it enables the treatment of mental health conditions and provides a safety net for individuals in crisis.\n- **Social support networks**, as they offer a sense of belonging and connection, which is critical for mental health.\n- **Nutrition and diet**, as a healthy diet provides the necessary building blocks for mental well-being.\n- **Sleep and relaxation**, as adequate rest and relaxation are essential for emotional regulation and stress management.\n- **Cognitive-behavioral therapy**, as it provides individuals with the tools and strategies necessary to manage their mental health conditions.\n\n## Common Gaps\nPeople often overlook the importance of **social connections** in maintaining mental health, assuming that individual strength and resilience are sufficient to overcome mental health challenges, which can lead to social isolation and increased symptoms of mental illness, as seen in the case of individuals who experience increased feelings of loneliness after relocating to a new city without establishing a social support network (Psychology Today).",
