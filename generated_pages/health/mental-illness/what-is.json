  "content": "## Definition\nMental illness is a condition that affects a person's thinking, feeling, and behavior, as described by Emil Kraepelin, a German psychiatrist, in his 1883 textbook on psychiatry.\n\n## How It Works\nMental illness can be understood through the **biopsychosocial model**, which suggests that biological, psychological, and social factors interact to contribute to the development of mental health issues. For example, the **dopamine hypothesis** of schizophrenia, proposed by Arvid Carlsson and others, suggests that an imbalance of dopamine in the brain contributes to the development of schizophrenia, with approximately 1% of the global population affected (World Health Organization). The **stress-vulnerability model**, developed by Zubin and Spring, also highlights the role of stress in triggering mental illness in individuals with a pre-existing vulnerability.\n\nThe development of mental illness can also be influenced by **genetic factors**, with heritability estimates ranging from 30% to 50% for conditions such as depression and anxiety disorders (National Institute of Mental Health). Additionally, **environmental factors**, such as childhood trauma and social support, can also contribute to the development of mental illness, with approximately 70% of adults in the United States reporting at least one adverse childhood experience (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).\n\nThe **DSM-5**, a widely used diagnostic manual, provides a framework for understanding and diagnosing mental illness, with over 150 distinct diagnoses, including **major depressive disorder**, **post-traumatic stress disorder**, and **bipolar disorder**. The **WHO's International Classification of Diseases** also provides a comprehensive framework for understanding mental illness, with over 100 diagnoses, including **schizophrenia** and **anxiety disorders**.\n\n## Key Components\n- **Cognitive symptoms**: changes in thought patterns, such as distorted or unrealistic thinking, which can impact daily functioning and relationships, with approximately 40% of individuals with mental illness experiencing cognitive impairment (National Institute of Mental Health).\n- **Emotional symptoms**: changes in emotional experience, such as intense feelings of anxiety or depression, which can impact daily functioning and relationships, with approximately 20% of adults in the United States experiencing an anxiety disorder (Anxiety and Depression Association of America).\n- **Behavioral symptoms**: changes in behavior, such as social withdrawal or aggression, which can impact daily functioning and relationships, with approximately 10% of adults in the United States experiencing a serious mental illness (National Institute of Mental Health).\n- **Social support**: the presence or absence of social support from family, friends, and community, which can impact the development and course of mental illness, with approximately 70% of adults in the United States reporting that social support is important for their mental health (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).\n- **Access to care**: the availability and accessibility of mental health services, which can impact the diagnosis, treatment, and outcome of mental illness, with approximately 40% of individuals with mental illness in the United States not receiving treatment (National Institute of Mental Health).\n- **Stigma**: the presence or absence of negative attitudes and beliefs about mental illness, which can impact the willingness to seek help and the course of mental illness, with approximately 50% of adults in the United States reporting that they would not want others to know if they were experiencing a mental health issue (National Alliance on Mental Illness).\n\n## Common Misconceptions\n**Myth:** Mental illness is a sign of weakness \u2014 **Fact:** Mental illness is a medical condition that can affect anyone, regardless of their strength or resilience, with approximately 1 in 5 adults in the United States experiencing a mental illness each year (National Institute of Mental Health).\n**Myth:** People with mental illness are violent \u2014 **Fact:** The vast majority of people with mental illness are not violent, with approximately 3% of violent crime committed by individuals with a serious mental illness (National Institute of Mental Health).\n**Myth:** Mental illness is caused by poor parenting \u2014 **Fact:** Mental illness is a complex condition that is influenced by a combination of genetic, environmental, and social factors, with no single cause (American Psychological Association).\n**Myth:** Mental illness only affects adults \u2014 **Fact:** Mental illness can affect individuals of all ages, including children and adolescents, with approximately 13% of children in the United States experiencing a mental health issue (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).\n\n## In Practice\nIn the United States, the **National Institute of Mental Health** provides funding for research and education on mental illness, with a budget of over $1.5 billion annually (National Institute of Mental Health). The **Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration** also provides funding and support for mental health services, with over 10 million adults in the United States receiving mental health treatment each year (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration). In Australia, the **Australian Government Department of Health** has implemented a national mental health plan, with a budget of over $1 billion annually, to improve access to mental health services and reduce the stigma associated with mental illness (Australian Government Department of Health).",
