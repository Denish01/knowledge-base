# Types of Mental Illness

There are five main categories of mental illness, which can be organized based on their primary symptoms and characteristics. 
## Main Categories
- **Mood Disorders** — characterized by disturbances in emotional states, such as depression or mania, with a notable example being **Major Depressive Disorder**, which affects individuals like actress Emma Thompson.
- **Anxiety Disorders** — marked by excessive fear or anxiety, with **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)** being a prominent example, as seen in the case of former US Senator Tammy Duckworth.
- **Psychotic Disorders** — involving a disconnection from reality, with **Schizophrenia** being a well-known example, as experienced by mathematician John Nash.
- **Personality Disorders** — characterized by enduring patterns of inner experience and behavior that deviate from cultural norms, with **Borderline Personality Disorder** being a notable example, as seen in the life of actress Britney Spears.
- **Trauma and Stressor-Related Disorders** — resulting from exposure to traumatic events, with **Acute Stress Disorder** being an example, as experienced by survivors of the 9/11 attacks.

## Comparison Table
| Category | Primary Symptoms | Treatment Options | Risk Factors |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mood Disorders | Emotional disturbances | Medication, therapy | Family history, brain chemistry |
| Anxiety Disorders | Excessive fear or anxiety | Therapy, medication | Genetics, life experiences |
| Psychotic Disorders | Disconnection from reality | Medication, therapy | Family history, substance abuse |
| Personality Disorders | Enduring behavior patterns | Therapy, medication | Childhood experiences, genetics |
| Trauma and Stressor-Related Disorders | Trauma responses | Therapy, medication | Traumatic events, genetics |

## How They Relate
Mood Disorders and Anxiety Disorders often overlap, as individuals with **Major Depressive Disorder** may also experience **Generalized Anxiety Disorder**. Psychotic Disorders, such as **Schizophrenia**, can be confused with Mood Disorders, but are distinct due to their characteristic disconnection from reality. Personality Disorders, like **Borderline Personality Disorder**, can increase the risk of developing Mood Disorders or Anxiety Disorders. Trauma and Stressor-Related Disorders, such as **Acute Stress Disorder**, can be a precursor to the development of other mental health conditions, like **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder**. Additionally, individuals with a history of **Substance Abuse** are at higher risk of developing Psychotic Disorders or Mood Disorders. The **Diathesis-Stress Model** suggests that mental illnesses result from the interaction between genetic predispositions and environmental stressors, highlighting the complex relationships between these categories.
