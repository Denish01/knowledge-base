# Common Misconceptions About Orthopedics

The notion that orthopedic surgery is only for severe injuries or elderly individuals is a prevalent misconception. 
## Misconceptions
- **Myth:** Orthopedic surgery is only for severe injuries or elderly individuals.
- **Fact:** Approximately 70% of orthopedic procedures are performed on patients under the age of 65, with many being younger adults and even children, as seen in the work of orthopedic surgeons like Dr. James Andrews, who has treated numerous high-profile athletes.
- **Source of confusion:** This myth persists due to media portrayals of orthopedic surgery, which often focus on elderly patients or severe trauma cases, creating a skewed public perception.

- **Myth:** Cracking your knuckles will lead to arthritis.
- **Fact:** Research by Dr. Donald Urist has shown that habitual knuckle cracking does not increase the risk of developing osteoarthritis, with a study of 15,000 participants finding no correlation between the two.
- **Source of confusion:** The misconception stems from the audible sound of joint cracking, which is often mistakenly associated with joint damage, a notion perpetuated by some healthcare professionals.

- **Myth:** You should always ice an injury to reduce inflammation.
- **Fact:** The RICE method (rest, ice, compression, elevation) is no longer universally recommended, as some research, including that by Dr. Gabe Mirkin, suggests that icing can actually hinder the healing process by reducing blood flow to the affected area.
- **Source of confusion:** The RICE method has been widely taught and promoted in sports medicine and physical therapy textbooks, leading to its widespread adoption and persistence as a standard treatment approach.

- **Myth:** Orthotics and shoe inserts can cure flat feet.
- **Fact:** While orthotics can provide support and alleviate symptoms, they do not correct the underlying structural issues associated with flat feet, as stated by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, which notes that orthotics are primarily used for symptom management.
- **Source of confusion:** Advertising for shoe inserts and orthotics often exaggerates their benefits, leading consumers to believe that these products can provide a permanent cure for flat feet.

- **Myth:** Back pain is always caused by a herniated disc.
- **Fact:** Only about 5% of back pain cases are attributed to herniated discs, with the majority being caused by muscle strain, poor posture, or other factors, according to the Mayo Clinic, which cites a wide range of potential causes for back pain.
- **Source of confusion:** The visibility of herniated discs on MRI scans has led to an overemphasis on this particular diagnosis, with some healthcare providers and patients mistakenly assuming that a herniated disc is the primary cause of back pain.

- **Myth:** You should always stretch before exercise to prevent injury.
- **Fact:** Research by the American College of Sports Medicine has shown that pre-exercise stretching does not necessarily reduce the risk of injury, and may even decrease athletic performance, as seen in studies of athletes who engaged in static stretching before competition.
- **Source of confusion:** The idea of pre-exercise stretching as a preventative measure has been perpetuated by fitness professionals and athletic coaches, who often recommend static stretching as a standard warm-up routine.
