# What Is Orthopedics?

## Definition
Orthopedics is a branch of medicine that deals with the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of disorders and injuries of the musculoskeletal system, which includes bones, joints, muscles, and related structures, with the term "orthopedics" coined by Nicholas Andry in 1741.

## How It Works
Orthopedic care involves a multidisciplinary approach, with orthopedic surgeons, physical therapists, and other healthcare professionals working together to provide comprehensive treatment. The musculoskeletal system is composed of 206 bones, 640 muscles, and over 400 joints, all of which can be affected by a range of conditions, including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and osteoporosis. According to the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS), approximately 50% of individuals over the age of 65 experience some form of musculoskeletal disorder.

Orthopedic surgeons use a range of techniques, including **arthroscopy**, **osteotomy**, and **joint replacement**, to treat various conditions. Arthroscopy, for example, involves the use of a small camera and surgical instruments to diagnose and treat joint problems, such as torn ligaments or cartilage damage. The **Ilizarov method**, developed by Gavril Ilizarov, is a technique used to lengthen or reshape bones, and has been used to treat conditions such as limb length discrepancy and bone defects. The **Ranawat classification system**, developed by Amar Ranawat, is used to classify the severity of hip fractures, and helps guide treatment decisions.

The **biomechanics** of the musculoskeletal system also play a critical role in orthopedic care. Understanding the mechanical properties of bones, joints, and muscles is essential for developing effective treatment plans. For example, the **Wolff's law** states that bones adapt to the loads placed upon them, and this principle is used to guide the development of exercise programs and orthopedic devices. The **National Institutes of Health (NIH)** has funded research on the biomechanics of the musculoskeletal system, with the goal of developing new treatments for musculoskeletal disorders.

## Key Components
- **Bones**: provide structural support and protection for the body, and are composed of a combination of **cortical** and **cancellous** bone tissue. When bone density decreases, the risk of fractures increases.
- **Joints**: allow for movement and flexibility, and are composed of **cartilage**, **ligaments**, and **tendons**. When joint cartilage is damaged, it can lead to conditions such as osteoarthritis.
- **Muscles**: provide movement and stability, and are composed of **skeletal** and **smooth** muscle tissue. When muscle mass decreases, it can lead to conditions such as sarcopenia.
- **Ligaments**: provide stability and support for joints, and are composed of **collagen** and **elastin** fibers. When ligaments are damaged, it can lead to conditions such as joint instability.
- **Tendons**: connect muscles to bones, and are composed of **collagen** and **elastin** fibers. When tendons are damaged, it can lead to conditions such as tendonitis.
- **Cartilage**: provides cushioning and support for joints, and is composed of **chondrocytes** and **matrix**. When cartilage is damaged, it can lead to conditions such as osteoarthritis.

## Common Misconceptions
**Myth:** Orthopedic surgeons only perform surgery — **Fact:** Orthopedic surgeons also provide non-surgical treatment, such as physical therapy and bracing, for a range of musculoskeletal conditions.
**Myth:** Osteoporosis only affects older adults — **Fact:** Osteoporosis can affect individuals of all ages, with the **National Osteoporosis Foundation** reporting that approximately 40% of men and 50% of women over the age of 50 will experience an osteoporosis-related fracture.
**Myth:** Arthritis is a single disease — **Fact:** Arthritis is a term that encompasses over 100 different conditions, including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriatic arthritis, with the **Arthritis Foundation** reporting that approximately 54 million adults in the United States have been diagnosed with some form of arthritis.
**Myth:** Exercise exacerbates musculoskeletal conditions — **Fact:** Regular exercise, such as **physical therapy**, can help improve joint mobility and reduce pain, with the **American College of Sports Medicine** recommending at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week for adults.

## In Practice
The **Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS)** in New York City is a leading orthopedic hospital, with over 30,000 surgical procedures performed annually. The hospital has a team of orthopedic surgeons, physical therapists, and other healthcare professionals who work together to provide comprehensive care for patients with musculoskeletal conditions. For example, the hospital's **Joint Replacement Center** performs over 10,000 joint replacement surgeries per year, with a **revision rate** of less than 1%, according to the **New York State Department of Health**. The hospital also has a **research program** that focuses on developing new treatments for musculoskeletal conditions, with funding from organizations such as the **National Institutes of Health (NIH)**.
