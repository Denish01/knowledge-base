# Types of Orthopedics

There are five main categories of orthopedics, organized by the type of condition or procedure: **Musculoskeletal Orthopedics**, **Surgical Orthopedics**, **Pediatric Orthopedics**, **Sports Orthopedics**, and **Rehabilitation Orthopedics**.

## Main Categories
- **Musculoskeletal Orthopedics** — focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of disorders and injuries affecting the musculoskeletal system, including conditions such as osteoarthritis, with a notable example being the work of the **Rothman Orthopaedic Institute**.
- **Surgical Orthopedics** — involves the use of surgical procedures to repair or replace damaged or diseased bones, joints, and soft tissues, with a prominent example being the **Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) reconstruction surgery** performed by orthopedic surgeons like **Dr. James Andrews**.
- **Pediatric Orthopedics** — specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of musculoskeletal disorders and injuries in children, including conditions such as scoliosis, with a notable example being the **Shriners Hospitals for Children**.
- **Sports Orthopedics** — focuses on the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of injuries and conditions affecting athletes and individuals who engage in sports and physical activity, with a prominent example being the **American Sports Medicine Institute (ASMI)**.
- **Rehabilitation Orthopedics** — involves the use of physical therapy, occupational therapy, and other rehabilitation techniques to help patients recover from orthopedic injuries or surgery, with a notable example being the **Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago (RIC)**.

## Comparison Table
| Category | Cost | Scale | Speed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Musculoskeletal Orthopedics** | High | Large | Medium |
| **Surgical Orthopedics** | Very High | Small | Fast |
| **Pediatric Orthopedics** | Medium | Medium | Slow |
| **Sports Orthopedics** | High | Large | Fast |
| **Rehabilitation Orthopedics** | Low | Large | Slow |

## How They Relate
The categories of orthopedics often overlap, with **Musculoskeletal Orthopedics** and **Surgical Orthopedics** frequently intersecting in the diagnosis and treatment of conditions such as osteoarthritis, where surgical procedures like joint replacement may be necessary. **Pediatric Orthopedics** and **Rehabilitation Orthopedics** may also overlap in the treatment of conditions such as scoliosis, where rehabilitation techniques are used to help patients recover from surgery. **Sports Orthopedics** and **Surgical Orthopedics** are also closely related, as surgical procedures like **ACL reconstruction** are often necessary to treat injuries sustained by athletes. Additionally, **Rehabilitation Orthopedics** and **Musculoskeletal Orthopedics** may be confused, as both involve the use of non-surgical techniques to treat musculoskeletal disorders, but **Rehabilitation Orthopedics** tends to focus more on the recovery process after injury or surgery, while **Musculoskeletal Orthopedics** focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of a wide range of musculoskeletal conditions.
