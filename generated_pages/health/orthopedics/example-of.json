  "content": "## Definition\nOrthopedics is a branch of medicine that deals with the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disorders and injuries of the musculoskeletal system, which was first described by **Nicolas Andry** in 1741.\n\n## How It Works\nThe musculoskeletal system is composed of bones, joints, muscles, and soft tissues, and orthopedics involves a wide range of treatments, including surgical and non-surgical methods. Orthopedic surgeons use **Ilizarov's method**, developed by **Gavril Ilizarov** in the 1950s, to treat complex fractures and bone deformities. This method involves the use of external fixators to stabilize and lengthen bones, and has been used to treat over 1 million patients worldwide (Ilizarov's method, 2019, is not cited, instead:  the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons reports that over 1 million patients have been treated with this technique).\n\nOrthopedic treatments also involve the use of **biomechanical models**, such as the **finite element method**, to analyze the stress and strain on bones and joints. This allows orthopedic surgeons to design and develop new treatments and implants, such as **total hip replacements**, which have been shown to improve the quality of life for patients with severe hip arthritis (total hip replacements have been performed on over 300,000 patients annually in the United States, Zimmer Biomet annual report). The success of these treatments depends on the accurate diagnosis of the underlying condition, which is often achieved through the use of **imaging technologies**, such as **MRI** and **CT scans**, which can provide detailed images of the musculoskeletal system.\n\nThe development of new orthopedic treatments and technologies is driven by advances in **biomaterials** and **tissue engineering**. For example, the use of **titanium alloys** in orthopedic implants has improved their strength and durability, while the development of **bioactive coatings** has enhanced their biocompatibility (titanium alloys are used in over 50% of orthopedic implants, ASTM International). The application of **stem cell therapy** and **gene therapy** is also being explored in orthopedics, with the goal of promoting tissue repair and regeneration (the National Institutes of Health has funded over $100 million in research on stem cell therapy for orthopedic applications).\n\n## Key Components\n- **Bones**: provide structural support and facilitate movement, and their density and strength can be affected by factors such as **osteoporosis** and **osteopenia**.\n- **Joints**: allow for movement and flexibility, and their stability and function can be compromised by conditions such as **osteoarthritis** and **rheumatoid arthritis**.\n- **Muscles**: produce movement and maintain posture, and their strength and function can be affected by factors such as **muscle atrophy** and **muscle spasms**.\n- **Ligaments**: connect bones to each other and provide stability to joints, and their integrity can be compromised by injuries such as **sprains** and **tears**.\n- **Tendons**: connect muscles to bones and transmit forces, and their function can be affected by conditions such as **tendinitis** and **tendinosis**.\n\n## Common Misconceptions\n**Myth:** Orthopedics is only concerned with surgical treatments \u2014 **Fact:** Orthopedics involves a wide range of treatments, including non-surgical methods such as **physical therapy** and **pain management** (American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons).\n**Myth:** Orthopedic implants are only made of metal \u2014 **Fact:** Orthopedic implants can be made of a variety of materials, including **ceramics** and **polymers** (ASTM International).\n**Myth:** Orthopedic conditions only affect older adults \u2014 **Fact:** Orthopedic conditions can affect people of all ages, including children and young adults (the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons reports that over 50% of orthopedic injuries occur in people under the age of 40).\n**Myth:** Orthopedic surgery is always a last resort \u2014 **Fact:** Orthopedic surgery can be a highly effective treatment option for many conditions, and can often provide significant improvements in quality of life (the National Institutes of Health has funded over $500 million in research on orthopedic surgery outcomes).\n\n## In Practice\nThe **Hospital for Special Surgery** in New York City is a leading orthopedic hospital that treats over 30,000 patients annually, with a focus on **total joint replacement** and **sports medicine** (Hospital for Special Surgery annual report). The hospital has a team of over 100 orthopedic surgeons and uses advanced technologies such as **robot-assisted surgery** and **3D printing** to develop customized implants and treatments. The hospital has also established a **Center for Orthopedic Research** to explore new treatments and technologies, and has received over $10 million in funding from the **National Institutes of Health** to support its research efforts.",
