# What Orthopedics Depends On

Anatomical knowledge is the most critical dependency for orthopedics, as incorrect understanding of human anatomy can lead to misdiagnosis and ineffective treatment, such as the case of the Thalidomide disaster, where lack of understanding of embryonic development led to severe birth defects.

## Key Dependencies
- **Anatomical Knowledge** — understanding of human anatomy is crucial for orthopedics, as it allows for accurate diagnosis and effective treatment of musculoskeletal disorders. Without it, treatment can be ineffective or even harmful, as seen in the case of the Thalidomide disaster.
- **Biomechanics** — knowledge of the mechanical properties of living tissues is necessary for understanding the effects of injury or disease on the musculoskeletal system, and for developing effective treatments, such as prosthetics and orthotics. For example, a lack of understanding of biomechanics led to the failure of early hip replacement implants, which were prone to loosening and failure.
- **Imaging Technologies** — access to imaging technologies such as X-rays, CT scans, and MRI is essential for diagnosing and monitoring musculoskeletal disorders, as it allows for accurate visualization of the affected area. Without it, diagnosis and treatment can be delayed or incorrect, as seen in the case of a patient who was misdiagnosed with a simple sprain, when in fact they had a more serious condition that required immediate attention.
- **Surgical Skills** — proficiency in surgical techniques is necessary for performing orthopedic procedures, such as joint replacements and fracture repairs. A lack of surgical skills can lead to complications and poor outcomes, as seen in the case of a surgeon who performed a botched hip replacement, resulting in permanent disability for the patient.
- **Rehabilitation Therapies** — access to rehabilitation therapies such as physical therapy and occupational therapy is necessary for helping patients recover from orthopedic procedures and injuries, and for preventing future injuries. Without it, patients may not fully recover, as seen in the case of a patient who was not provided with adequate physical therapy after a knee replacement, resulting in chronic pain and limited mobility.
- **Pharmacology** — knowledge of pharmacology is necessary for understanding the effects of medications on the musculoskeletal system, and for developing effective treatment plans. For example, a lack of understanding of pharmacology led to the overprescription of opioid painkillers, which has contributed to the opioid epidemic.

## Priority Order
The dependencies can be ranked in order of priority as follows:
1. **Anatomical Knowledge** — this is the most critical dependency, as incorrect understanding of human anatomy can lead to misdiagnosis and ineffective treatment.
2. **Biomechanics** — this is the second most critical dependency, as understanding the mechanical properties of living tissues is necessary for developing effective treatments.
3. **Imaging Technologies** — this is the third most critical dependency, as access to imaging technologies is essential for diagnosing and monitoring musculoskeletal disorders.
4. **Surgical Skills** — this is the fourth most critical dependency, as proficiency in surgical techniques is necessary for performing orthopedic procedures.
5. **Rehabilitation Therapies** — this is the fifth most critical dependency, as access to rehabilitation therapies is necessary for helping patients recover from orthopedic procedures and injuries.
6. **Pharmacology** — this is the sixth most critical dependency, as knowledge of pharmacology is necessary for understanding the effects of medications on the musculoskeletal system.

## Common Gaps
One common gap in orthopedics is the assumption that patients will adhere to treatment plans without adequate education and support. This can lead to poor outcomes, as patients may not fully understand their condition or the necessary steps for recovery. For example, a patient who is not provided with adequate instructions on how to use a prosthetic limb may experience difficulty with mobility and daily activities, leading to frustration and decreased quality of life.
