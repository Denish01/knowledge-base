# What Affects Orthopedics

Obesity is the single biggest factor affecting orthopedics, as excess body weight increases the strain on joints by 2-3 times (American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons), leading to a higher risk of osteoarthritis and joint replacements, with approximately 65% of obese individuals developing osteoarthritis (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).

## Main Factors
- **Age** — the wear and tear on joints increases with age, leading to a higher risk of osteoarthritis and fractures, with the incidence of hip fractures increasing by 20% per decade after age 50 (National Institutes of Health), as seen in the case of a 75-year-old patient who underwent a total hip replacement due to severe osteoarthritis.
- **Genetics** — inherited traits such as joint shape and size can increase the risk of orthopedic conditions, with certain genetic mutations increasing the risk of osteoarthritis by 30% (Orthopaedic Research Society), as observed in a family with a history of hip dysplasia.
- **Trauma** — injuries such as fractures and sprains can lead to long-term orthopedic problems, with 40% of patients with severe ankle sprains developing chronic ankle instability (American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society), as seen in the case of a professional athlete who suffered a severe ankle sprain that required surgical reconstruction.
- **Repetitive strain** — repetitive movements and activities can cause wear and tear on joints, leading to conditions such as tendinitis and bursitis, with 25% of workers in repetitive jobs developing musculoskeletal disorders (Occupational Safety and Health Administration), as observed in a factory worker who developed carpal tunnel syndrome due to repetitive assembly tasks.
- **Nutrition** — poor nutrition, particularly a lack of calcium and vitamin D, can increase the risk of osteoporosis and fractures, with a 10% increase in calcium intake reducing the risk of fractures by 20% (National Osteoporosis Foundation), as seen in a patient with a history of osteoporosis who was treated with calcium and vitamin D supplements.
- **Smoking** — smoking can decrease bone density and increase the risk of fractures, with smokers having a 30% higher risk of hip fractures compared to non-smokers (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), as observed in a smoker who suffered a hip fracture due to osteoporosis.
- **Physical activity** — regular exercise can strengthen bones and muscles, but excessive exercise can increase the risk of overuse injuries, with 50% of marathon runners developing overuse injuries (American College of Sports Medicine), as seen in a runner who developed a stress fracture due to excessive training.

## How They Interact
The interaction between **age** and **obesity** can amplify the risk of osteoarthritis, as seen in a 60-year-old obese patient who developed severe osteoarthritis due to the combined effects of age and excess weight. The interaction between **trauma** and **repetitive strain** can also increase the risk of long-term orthopedic problems, as observed in a worker who developed chronic back pain due to a combination of work-related injuries and repetitive lifting tasks. The interaction between **nutrition** and **physical activity** can have a positive effect, as seen in an athlete who strengthened their bones and muscles through a combination of regular exercise and a balanced diet, reducing their risk of overuse injuries.

## Controllable vs Uncontrollable
The controllable factors include **obesity**, **smoking**, **physical activity**, and **nutrition**, which can be controlled through lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise. These factors can be controlled by individuals, with support from healthcare professionals and public health initiatives. For example, a patient can work with a registered dietitian to develop a personalized nutrition plan, or participate in a smoking cessation program to reduce their risk of fractures. The uncontrollable factors include **age**, **genetics**, and **trauma**, which cannot be controlled by individuals. However, even in cases where the underlying factor is uncontrollable, individuals can still take steps to reduce their risk of orthopedic problems, such as wearing protective gear to reduce the risk of injuries or engaging in regular exercise to strengthen their bones and muscles.
