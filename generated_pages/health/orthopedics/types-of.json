  "content": "There are five main categories of orthopedics, organized by the type of condition or procedure: **Musculoskeletal Orthopedics**, **Surgical Orthopedics**, **Pediatric Orthopedics**, **Sports Orthopedics**, and **Rehabilitation Orthopedics**.\n\n## Main Categories\n- **Musculoskeletal Orthopedics** \u2014 focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of disorders and injuries affecting the musculoskeletal system, including conditions such as osteoarthritis, with a notable example being the work of the **Rothman Orthopaedic Institute**.\n- **Surgical Orthopedics** \u2014 involves the use of surgical procedures to repair or replace damaged or diseased bones, joints, and soft tissues, with a prominent example being the **Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) reconstruction surgery** performed by orthopedic surgeons like **Dr. James Andrews**.\n- **Pediatric Orthopedics** \u2014 specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of musculoskeletal disorders and injuries in children, including conditions such as scoliosis, with a notable example being the **Shriners Hospitals for Children**.\n- **Sports Orthopedics** \u2014 focuses on the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of injuries and conditions affecting athletes and individuals who engage in sports and physical activity, with a prominent example being the **American Sports Medicine Institute (ASMI)**.\n- **Rehabilitation Orthopedics** \u2014 involves the use of physical therapy, occupational therapy, and other rehabilitation techniques to help patients recover from orthopedic injuries or surgery, with a notable example being the **Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago (RIC)**.\n\n## Comparison Table\n| Category | Cost | Scale | Speed |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Musculoskeletal Orthopedics** | High | Large | Medium |\n| **Surgical Orthopedics** | Very High | Small | Fast |\n| **Pediatric Orthopedics** | Medium | Medium | Slow |\n| **Sports Orthopedics** | High | Large | Fast |\n| **Rehabilitation Orthopedics** | Low | Large | Slow |\n\n## How They Relate\nThe categories of orthopedics often overlap, with **Musculoskeletal Orthopedics** and **Surgical Orthopedics** frequently intersecting in the diagnosis and treatment of conditions such as osteoarthritis, where surgical procedures like joint replacement may be necessary. **Pediatric Orthopedics** and **Rehabilitation Orthopedics** may also overlap in the treatment of conditions such as scoliosis, where rehabilitation techniques are used to help patients recover from surgery. **Sports Orthopedics** and **Surgical Orthopedics** are also closely related, as surgical procedures like **ACL reconstruction** are often necessary to treat injuries sustained by athletes. Additionally, **Rehabilitation Orthopedics** and **Musculoskeletal Orthopedics** may be confused, as both involve the use of non-surgical techniques to treat musculoskeletal disorders, but **Rehabilitation Orthopedics** tends to focus more on the recovery process after injury or surgery, while **Musculoskeletal Orthopedics** focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of a wide range of musculoskeletal conditions.",
