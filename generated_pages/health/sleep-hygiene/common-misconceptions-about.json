  "content": "The most common misconception about sleep hygiene is that **sleeping in** on weekends can compensate for lack of sleep during the week. \n- **Myth:** Sleeping in on weekends can compensate for lack of sleep during the week.\n- **Fact:** The National Sleep Foundation states that sleeping in on weekends does not make up for sleep deprivation, as it disrupts the body's natural sleep-wake cycle, also known as the **circadian rhythm** (National Sleep Foundation).\n- **Source of confusion:** This myth persists due to the common media narrative that sleeping in is a way to \"catch up\" on sleep, which is often perpetuated by popular health and wellness blogs.\n\n- **Myth:** Drinking **alcohol** before bed helps with sleep.\n- **Fact:** The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism reports that alcohol consumption before bed can disrupt sleep patterns and reduce sleep quality, as it increases **sleep fragmentation** (National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism).\n- **Source of confusion:** This myth persists due to the misconception that alcohol is a sleep aid, which may have originated from the fact that alcohol can induce **relaxation** and help individuals fall asleep faster, but ultimately leads to poor sleep quality.\n\n- **Myth:** **Napping** during the day can interfere with nighttime sleep.\n- **Fact:** A study by NASA found that napping can improve cognitive function and reduce sleep pressure, with the ideal nap duration being around 20-30 minutes to avoid entering **deep sleep** (NASA).\n- **Source of confusion:** This myth may have originated from the idea that napping can lead to **sleep inertia**, which is the feeling of grogginess upon waking from a nap, but this can be avoided by keeping naps short and scheduled at the right time.\n\n- **Myth:** **Electronic devices** before bed do not affect sleep.\n- **Fact:** The American Academy of Sleep Medicine reports that exposure to **blue light** from electronic devices before bed can suppress **melatonin** production, making it harder to fall asleep (American Academy of Sleep Medicine).\n- **Source of confusion:** This myth may have originated from the lack of awareness about the effects of blue light on the body's natural sleep-wake cycle, which is often not discussed in popular media.\n\n- **Myth:** **Older adults** need less sleep than younger adults.\n- **Fact:** The National Institute on Aging states that older adults still need 7-9 hours of sleep per night, as sleep needs do not decrease with age, but rather the ability to achieve **restorative sleep** may decline (National Institute on Aging).\n- **Source of confusion:** This myth may have originated from the observation that older adults often have different sleep patterns, such as waking up earlier, but this does not mean they need less sleep.\n\n- **Myth:** **Sleep disorders** are rare and only affect a small portion of the population.\n- **Fact:** The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that approximately 30% of the general population experiences **insomnia**, making it a common sleep disorder (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).\n- **Source of confusion:** This myth may have originated from the lack of awareness about sleep disorders and their prevalence, which is often not discussed in public health campaigns.\n\n## Quick Reference\n- Sleeping in on weekends \u2192 does not compensate for lack of sleep during the week (National Sleep Foundation)\n- Drinking alcohol before bed \u2192 disrupts sleep patterns and reduces sleep quality (National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism)\n- Napping during the day \u2192 can improve cognitive function and reduce sleep pressure if done correctly (NASA)\n- Electronic devices before bed \u2192 can suppress melatonin production and interfere with sleep (American Academy of Sleep Medicine)\n- Older adults need less sleep \u2192 still need 7-9 hours of sleep per night (National Institute on Aging)\n- Sleep disorders are rare \u2192 approximately 30% of the general population experiences insomnia (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)",
