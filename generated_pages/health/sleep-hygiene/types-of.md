# Types of Sleep Hygiene

There are five main categories of sleep hygiene, organized by their focus on behavioral, environmental, psychological, physiological, and lifestyle factors. 
## Main Categories
- **Stimulus Control** — involves removing or reducing stimuli that interfere with sleep, such as turning off electronics before bedtime, and is exemplified by the **National Sleep Foundation's** recommendation to avoid screens for at least an hour before bedtime, as seen in the sleep habits of **Jeff Bezos**, who prioritizes a consistent sleep schedule.
- **Sleep Schedule Regulation** — requires maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, even on weekends, to regulate the body's internal clock, as demonstrated by **Tim Ferriss**, who prioritizes waking up at the same time every day, including weekends.
- **Sleep Environment Optimization** — involves creating a sleep-conducive environment, such as keeping the bedroom cool, dark, and quiet, as achieved by **Arianna Huffington**, who designed her bedroom to promote relaxation and sleep.
- **Relaxation Techniques** — encompasses methods to calm the mind and body before sleep, such as meditation or deep breathing, as practiced by **Richard Branson**, who uses meditation to unwind before bed.
- **Lifestyle Habits** — includes habits that promote overall health and well-being, such as regular exercise and a balanced diet, as exemplified by **Michelle Obama**, who prioritizes healthy eating and regular physical activity to support her sleep.

## Comparison Table
| Category | Cost | Scale | Speed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Stimulus Control | Low | Individual | Immediate |
| Sleep Schedule Regulation | Low | Individual | Gradual |
| Sleep Environment Optimization | Medium | Individual | Immediate |
| Relaxation Techniques | Low | Individual | Immediate |
| Lifestyle Habits | Medium | Individual | Gradual |

## How They Relate
The categories of sleep hygiene often overlap and feed into each other, with **Stimulus Control** and **Sleep Environment Optimization** being closely related, as a sleep-conducive environment is essential for removing stimuli that interfere with sleep. **Sleep Schedule Regulation** and **Lifestyle Habits** are also interconnected, as a consistent sleep schedule can be supported by healthy lifestyle habits, such as regular exercise and a balanced diet. **Relaxation Techniques** can be used in conjunction with **Stimulus Control** and **Sleep Environment Optimization** to create a sleep-conducive environment and reduce stimuli that interfere with sleep. For example, **mindfulness meditation** can help reduce stress and promote relaxation, making it easier to fall asleep in a sleep-conducive environment. Specific pairs, such as **Stimulus Control** and **Relaxation Techniques**, are commonly confused, as both involve techniques to calm the mind and body before sleep, but **Stimulus Control** focuses on removing external stimuli, while **Relaxation Techniques** focus on internal relaxation methods.
