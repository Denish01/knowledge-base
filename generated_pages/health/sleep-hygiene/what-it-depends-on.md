# What Sleep Hygiene Depends On

Consistent **sleep schedule** is the most critical dependency for sleep hygiene, as its absence can lead to desynchronization of the body's natural circadian rhythm, causing sleep disorders and related health problems, such as those experienced by shift workers at Boeing, who produce ~800 aircraft annually (Boeing annual report), and often suffer from sleep-related issues due to irregular working hours.

## Key Dependencies
- **Sleep-conducive environment** — a dark, quiet, and cool environment is required for quality sleep, as it helps regulate the body's natural sleep-wake cycle, and its absence can lead to poor sleep quality, as seen in the case of residents near London's Heathrow airport, who have reported sleep disturbances due to noise pollution.
- **Regular physical activity** — regular exercise is necessary for sleep hygiene, as it helps reduce stress and anxiety, which can interfere with sleep, and its absence can lead to insomnia, as experienced by sedentary office workers, such as those at Microsoft, where a lack of physical activity has been linked to sleep disorders.
- **Cognitive behavioral therapy** — this type of therapy is essential for addressing underlying sleep disorders, such as insomnia, and its absence can lead to chronic sleep problems, as seen in the case of patients with untreated sleep apnea, who often experience daytime fatigue and related health issues.
- **Nutrition and diet** — a balanced diet that includes foods rich in sleep-promoting nutrients, such as melatonin and serotonin, is necessary for sleep hygiene, as it helps regulate the body's natural sleep-wake cycle, and its absence can lead to sleep disorders, as experienced by individuals with dietary deficiencies, such as those with vitamin B12 deficiency.
- **Electronic device use** — avoiding electronic devices before bedtime is crucial for sleep hygiene, as the blue light emitted from these devices can suppress melatonin production, leading to poor sleep quality, as seen in the case of teenagers who use their smartphones before bedtime, and often experience sleep deprivation.

## Priority Order
Ranking the dependencies from most to least critical, the order is: 
- **sleep schedule**, as its irregularity can lead to desynchronization of the body's natural circadian rhythm, causing sleep disorders and related health problems.
- **sleep-conducive environment**, as a dark, quiet, and cool environment is essential for quality sleep, and its absence can lead to poor sleep quality.
- **regular physical activity**, as exercise helps reduce stress and anxiety, which can interfere with sleep, and its absence can lead to insomnia.
- **nutrition and diet**, as a balanced diet is necessary for regulating the body's natural sleep-wake cycle, and its absence can lead to sleep disorders.
- **cognitive behavioral therapy**, as it is essential for addressing underlying sleep disorders, but its absence may not have as immediate an impact as the other dependencies.
- **electronic device use**, as avoiding electronic devices before bedtime is crucial, but its impact may be less severe than the other dependencies, as it can be mitigated with blue light filtering glasses or apps.

## Common Gaps
People often overlook or take for granted the importance of a **consistent sleep schedule**, assuming that they can catch up on sleep during the weekends or with naps, but this can lead to sleep inertia, a feeling of grogginess and disorientation upon waking, as experienced by individuals who work non-traditional hours, such as nurses, who often suffer from sleep-related issues due to irregular schedules.
