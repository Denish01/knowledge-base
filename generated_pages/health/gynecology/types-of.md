# Types of Gynecology

There are four primary categories of gynecology, organized by the specific focus and approach of each: **Preventive Gynecology**, **Reproductive Gynecology**, **Surgical Gynecology**, and **Oncologic Gynecology**.

## Main Categories
- **Preventive Gynecology** — focuses on routine check-ups, screenings, and preventive measures to maintain women's health, as seen in the work of the **American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)**, which provides guidelines for annual well-woman visits.
- **Reproductive Gynecology** — encompasses the diagnosis and treatment of issues related to fertility, pregnancy, and childbirth, including the management of **in vitro fertilization (IVF)** programs, such as those offered by the **New York Fertility Institute**.
- **Surgical Gynecology** — involves surgical interventions for conditions like fibroids, endometriosis, and uterine prolapse, with examples including the **da Vinci Surgical System**, used by surgeons like those at **Cedars-Sinai Medical Center**.
- **Oncologic Gynecology** — deals with the diagnosis, treatment, and management of gynecologic cancers, such as ovarian cancer, with institutions like **MD Anderson Cancer Center** providing specialized care.

## Comparison Table
| Category | Focus | Cost | Risk |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Preventive Gynecology | Routine check-ups and screenings | Low (~$100 annual well-woman visit, ACOG) | Low |
| Reproductive Gynecology | Fertility and pregnancy issues | High (~$20,000 per IVF cycle, New York Fertility Institute) | Moderate |
| Surgical Gynecology | Surgical interventions for gynecologic conditions | Moderate to High (~$10,000 to $50,000 per surgery, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center) | High |
| Oncologic Gynecology | Gynecologic cancer diagnosis and treatment | High (~$100,000 per year of treatment, MD Anderson Cancer Center) | Very High |

## How They Relate
While these categories are distinct, they often overlap and intersect in patient care. For instance, **Preventive Gynecology** and **Reproductive Gynecology** may both be involved in the management of a patient with **polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)**, as preventive measures can help mitigate the condition's effects on fertility. Similarly, **Surgical Gynecology** and **Oncologic Gynecology** may both be necessary for a patient with ovarian cancer, as surgery is often a component of cancer treatment. The **ACOG** and **Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO)** provide guidelines that can help clarify the relationships between these categories and ensure comprehensive patient care. Specifically, the **ACOG** and **American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM)** collaboration on guidelines for infertility treatment highlights the interconnectedness of **Reproductive Gynecology** and **Preventive Gynecology**.
