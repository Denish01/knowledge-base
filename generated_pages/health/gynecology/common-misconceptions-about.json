  "content": "Most people believe that **hysterectomies** are commonly performed to treat most **gynecological disorders**, but this is not the case. \n## Misconceptions\n- **Myth:** Hysterectomies are commonly performed to treat most gynecological disorders.\n- **Fact:** Only about 10% of hysterectomies are performed to treat cancer, while the majority are performed to treat conditions like uterine fibroids, endometriosis, and prolapse, with ~600,000 procedures performed annually in the US (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists).\n- **Source of confusion:** This myth persists due to outdated textbooks that overemphasize the role of hysterectomies in treating gynecological disorders.\n- **Myth:** All women experience **menstrual cramps** as a normal part of their menstrual cycle.\n- **Fact:** While ~80% of women experience some level of menstrual cramp, the severity and frequency of cramps can vary greatly, with ~10% of women experiencing severe cramps that interfere with daily activities (World Health Organization).\n- **Source of confusion:** This myth persists due to the media narrative that menstrual cramps are a universal female experience, perpetuated by films and television shows.\n- **Myth:** **Pap smears** are the most effective method of cervical cancer screening.\n- **Fact:** Human papillomavirus (HPV) testing is actually more effective than Pap smears in detecting cervical cancer, with a sensitivity of ~90% compared to ~55% for Pap smears (National Cancer Institute).\n- **Source of confusion:** This myth persists due to the historical reliance on Pap smears as the primary method of cervical cancer screening, as outlined in older medical textbooks.\n- **Myth:** Women should undergo **annual mammograms** starting at age 40.\n- **Fact:** The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that women with an average risk of breast cancer undergo mammograms every other year starting at age 50, with ~40% of mammograms resulting in false positives (American College of Radiology).\n- **Source of confusion:** This myth persists due to the widespread media coverage of breast cancer awareness campaigns that often emphasize the importance of annual mammograms.\n- **Myth:** **Birth control pills** increase the risk of blood clots.\n- **Fact:** While birth control pills do increase the risk of blood clots, the overall risk is still relatively low, with ~1 in 1,000 women experiencing a blood clot while taking birth control pills (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).\n- **Source of confusion:** This myth persists due to the logical fallacy that any increased risk is equivalent to a high risk, which is not the case.\n- **Myth:** **Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)** is a rare hormonal disorder.\n- **Fact:** PCOS affects ~5-10% of women of childbearing age, making it one of the most common endocrine disorders among women of reproductive age (National Institute of Child Health and Human Development).\n- **Source of confusion:** This myth persists due to the lack of awareness and education about PCOS, which is often overlooked in medical textbooks and media narratives.\n\n## Quick Reference\n- Hysterectomies are commonly performed \u2192 Only ~10% of hysterectomies are performed to treat cancer.\n- All women experience menstrual cramps \u2192 ~80% of women experience some level of menstrual cramp.\n- Pap smears are the most effective method of cervical cancer screening \u2192 HPV testing is more effective than Pap smears.\n- Women should undergo annual mammograms starting at age 40 \u2192 Women with average risk should undergo mammograms every other year starting at age 50.\n- Birth control pills increase the risk of blood clots \u2192 ~1 in 1,000 women experience a blood clot while taking birth control pills.\n- PCOS is a rare hormonal disorder \u2192 PCOS affects ~5-10% of women of childbearing age.",
