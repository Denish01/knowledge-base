  "content": "There are four primary categories of gynecology, organized by the specific focus and approach of each: **Preventive Gynecology**, **Reproductive Gynecology**, **Surgical Gynecology**, and **Oncologic Gynecology**.\n\n## Main Categories\n- **Preventive Gynecology** \u2014 focuses on routine check-ups, screenings, and preventive measures to maintain women's health, as seen in the work of the **American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)**, which provides guidelines for annual well-woman visits.\n- **Reproductive Gynecology** \u2014 encompasses the diagnosis and treatment of issues related to fertility, pregnancy, and childbirth, including the management of **in vitro fertilization (IVF)** programs, such as those offered by the **New York Fertility Institute**.\n- **Surgical Gynecology** \u2014 involves surgical interventions for conditions like fibroids, endometriosis, and uterine prolapse, with examples including the **da Vinci Surgical System**, used by surgeons like those at **Cedars-Sinai Medical Center**.\n- **Oncologic Gynecology** \u2014 deals with the diagnosis, treatment, and management of gynecologic cancers, such as ovarian cancer, with institutions like **MD Anderson Cancer Center** providing specialized care.\n\n## Comparison Table\n| Category | Focus | Cost | Risk |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Preventive Gynecology | Routine check-ups and screenings | Low (~$100 annual well-woman visit, ACOG) | Low |\n| Reproductive Gynecology | Fertility and pregnancy issues | High (~$20,000 per IVF cycle, New York Fertility Institute) | Moderate |\n| Surgical Gynecology | Surgical interventions for gynecologic conditions | Moderate to High (~$10,000 to $50,000 per surgery, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center) | High |\n| Oncologic Gynecology | Gynecologic cancer diagnosis and treatment | High (~$100,000 per year of treatment, MD Anderson Cancer Center) | Very High |\n\n## How They Relate\nWhile these categories are distinct, they often overlap and intersect in patient care. For instance, **Preventive Gynecology** and **Reproductive Gynecology** may both be involved in the management of a patient with **polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)**, as preventive measures can help mitigate the condition's effects on fertility. Similarly, **Surgical Gynecology** and **Oncologic Gynecology** may both be necessary for a patient with ovarian cancer, as surgery is often a component of cancer treatment. The **ACOG** and **Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO)** provide guidelines that can help clarify the relationships between these categories and ensure comprehensive patient care. Specifically, the **ACOG** and **American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM)** collaboration on guidelines for infertility treatment highlights the interconnectedness of **Reproductive Gynecology** and **Preventive Gynecology**.",
