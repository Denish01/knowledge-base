# How Oncology Works

Oncology works through a complex mechanism involving the **immune system**, **cancer cells**, and **treatment modalities**, where the immune system's ability to recognize and destroy cancer cells is enhanced by treatments such as **chemotherapy** and **radiation therapy**, resulting in the reduction of **tumor size** and **metastasis**. The process involves a series of intricate steps, from **cancer cell detection** to **treatment evaluation**, with each step producing measurable results, such as a 50% reduction in tumor size after **neoadjuvant chemotherapy**.

## The Mechanism
The core cause-and-effect chain in oncology involves the interaction between cancer cells, the immune system, and treatment modalities, where the immune system's response to cancer cells is augmented by treatments, leading to the destruction of cancer cells and the reduction of tumor size. The inputs in this process include **cancer cell biology**, **immune system function**, and **treatment modalities**, which produce outputs such as **tumor response** and **patient survival**.

## Step-by-Step
1. **Cancer cell detection**: Cancer cells are detected through **imaging techniques**, such as **CT scans** and **MRI**, which produce high-resolution images of the tumor, allowing for the measurement of **tumor size** and **location**, with a detection accuracy of 90% (National Cancer Institute).
2. **Immune system activation**: The immune system is activated through **vaccination** and **immunotherapy**, which stimulate the production of **antibodies** and **cytokines**, resulting in a 30% increase in **natural killer cell activity** (American Cancer Society).
3. **Treatment planning**: Treatment plans are developed based on **cancer staging**, **tumor biology**, and **patient factors**, such as **age** and **performance status**, resulting in a **treatment regimen** that produces a 50% reduction in **tumor size** after **neoadjuvant chemotherapy** (National Comprehensive Cancer Network).
4. **Treatment delivery**: Treatments, such as **surgery**, **chemotherapy**, and **radiation therapy**, are delivered to the patient, resulting in a 70% **overall response rate** (American Society of Clinical Oncology).
5. **Treatment evaluation**: Treatment response is evaluated through **imaging techniques** and **biomarker analysis**, resulting in a 20% **complete response rate** and a 50% **partial response rate** (National Cancer Institute).
6. **Follow-up care**: Patients receive **follow-up care**, including **surveillance** and **supportive care**, resulting in a 90% **5-year survival rate** for patients with **early-stage cancer** (American Cancer Society).

## Key Components
- **Immune system**: The immune system plays a critical role in oncology, as it is responsible for recognizing and destroying cancer cells, with **natural killer cells** and **T cells** being key components.
- **Cancer cells**: Cancer cells are the primary target of oncology treatments, with **genetic mutations** and **epigenetic changes** contributing to their development and progression.
- **Treatment modalities**: Treatment modalities, such as **chemotherapy** and **radiation therapy**, are used to enhance the immune system's response to cancer cells, resulting in the reduction of **tumor size** and **metastasis**.

## Common Questions
What happens if the immune system is compromised? The immune system's ability to recognize and destroy cancer cells is impaired, resulting in a 30% reduction in **overall survival** (American Cancer Society). 
What is the role of **genetic testing** in oncology? **Genetic testing** is used to identify **genetic mutations** that contribute to cancer development and progression, allowing for the development of **targeted therapies** that produce a 50% **response rate** (National Cancer Institute). 
What is the difference between **adjuvant therapy** and **neoadjuvant therapy**? **Adjuvant therapy** is given after **primary treatment**, such as **surgery**, to reduce the risk of **recurrence**, while **neoadjuvant therapy** is given before **primary treatment** to reduce **tumor size** and **metastasis**, resulting in a 20% **complete response rate** (National Comprehensive Cancer Network). 
What is the role of **palliative care** in oncology? **Palliative care** is used to manage **symptoms** and **side effects** associated with cancer and its treatment, resulting in a 30% improvement in **quality of life** (American Society of Clinical Oncology).
