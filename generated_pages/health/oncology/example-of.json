  "content": "## Definition\nOncology is the branch of medicine that deals with the diagnosis, treatment, and study of cancer, originating from the Greek word \"onkos,\" meaning tumor, with significant contributions from **Rudolf Virchow**, a 19th-century German physician who first recognized the cellular basis of cancer.\n\n## How It Works\nThe diagnosis of cancer typically involves a combination of physical examinations, imaging tests, and **biopsy** procedures, where a sample of tissue is examined for abnormal cell growth, with the **TNM staging system** used to classify the extent of cancer spread. Cancer treatment often involves **surgery**, **chemotherapy**, and **radiation therapy**, which can be used alone or in combination, depending on the type and stage of cancer, with **hormone therapy** and **immunotherapy** also being used to treat specific types of cancer, such as breast and prostate cancer. The treatment of cancer is often guided by **clinical practice guidelines**, such as those developed by the **National Comprehensive Cancer Network**, which provide evidence-based recommendations for the management of different types of cancer, with ~1.8 million new cancer cases diagnosed annually in the United States (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).\n\nThe treatment of cancer can be further tailored to individual patients through the use of **molecular diagnostics**, which can identify specific genetic mutations or other molecular characteristics of a patient's cancer, with **next-generation sequencing** allowing for the rapid and cost-effective analysis of large amounts of genomic data. For example, the **BRCA1** and **BRCA2** genes are associated with an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer, with **genetic testing** available to identify individuals who carry these mutations, and **parp inhibitors** being used to treat cancers with **BRCA** mutations. The development of new cancer treatments is often driven by advances in our understanding of the **biology of cancer**, with **cancer stem cells** and the **tumor microenvironment** being areas of active research, and **Cancer Research UK** investing ~\u00a3400 million annually in cancer research.\n\nThe management of cancer also involves the use of **palliative care**, which focuses on relieving the symptoms and stress of cancer, rather than treating the cancer itself, with **hospice care** being used to support patients with advanced cancer, and **supportive care** being used to manage the side effects of cancer treatment. The use of **electronic health records** and **health information technology** can also improve the management of cancer, by facilitating the sharing of information between healthcare providers and patients, with **MD Anderson Cancer Center** using electronic health records to manage the care of its patients.\n\n## Key Components\n- **Tumor biology**: understanding the biology of cancer is critical to the development of effective treatments, with **cancer cell lines** being used to study the behavior of cancer cells in the laboratory.\n- **Imaging tests**: imaging tests, such as **CT scans** and **MRI scans**, are used to diagnose and stage cancer, with **PET scans** being used to monitor the response of cancer to treatment.\n- **Surgical oncology**: surgery is often used to treat cancer, with **lumpectomy** and **mastectomy** being used to treat breast cancer, and **prostatectomy** being used to treat prostate cancer.\n- **Chemotherapy**: chemotherapy is used to treat cancer, with **anthracyclines** and **taxanes** being used to treat breast cancer, and **platinum-based chemotherapy** being used to treat ovarian cancer.\n- **Clinical trials**: clinical trials are used to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of new cancer treatments, with **phase I**, **phase II**, and **phase III** trials being used to test the safety and efficacy of new treatments.\n- **Cancer registries**: cancer registries, such as the **Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program**, are used to collect data on cancer incidence and mortality, with ~14 million new cancer cases diagnosed worldwide annually (International Agency for Research on Cancer).\n\n## Common Misconceptions\n- **Myth:** Cancer is a single disease \u2014 **Fact:** Cancer is a group of more than 100 different diseases, with different types of cancer having distinct **histological** and **molecular** characteristics, and **lung cancer** being the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide (World Health Organization).\n- **Myth:** Cancer is always caused by **genetic mutations** \u2014 **Fact:** While genetic mutations can contribute to the development of cancer, **environmental factors**, such as **tobacco smoke** and **ultraviolet radiation**, also play a significant role, with ~30% of cancer deaths being attributable to tobacco use (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).\n- **Myth:** Cancer treatment is always **curative** \u2014 **Fact:** While cancer treatment can be curative for some types of cancer, **palliative care** is often used to manage the symptoms and stress of cancer, particularly for patients with advanced cancer, and **hospice care** being used to support patients with terminal cancer.\n- **Myth:** Cancer is a disease of **old age** \u2014 **Fact:** While the risk of cancer does increase with age, cancer can occur at any age, with ~10% of cancer cases being diagnosed in people under the age of 40 (National Cancer Institute).\n\n## In Practice\nThe **University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center** is a leading cancer treatment and research institution, with a **$1.3 billion** annual budget and ~8,000 employees, and **Bristol-Myers Squibb** investing ~$4 billion annually in cancer research and development. The center uses a **multidisciplinary approach** to cancer treatment, with **surgical oncologists**, **medical oncologists**, and **radiation oncologists** working together to develop individualized treatment plans for patients, and **cancer researchers** using **next-generation sequencing** to identify new targets for cancer therapy. The center also has a **$200 million** annual budget for **clinical trials**, with ~1,000 clinical trials being conducted annually, and **IBM Watson for Oncology** being used to support cancer treatment decisions.",
