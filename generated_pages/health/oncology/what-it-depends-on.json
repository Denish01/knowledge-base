  "content": "Radiology is the most critical dependency for oncology, as accurate imaging is required for cancer diagnosis and treatment planning, and its absence can lead to incorrect diagnoses, such as the case of the patient who was misdiagnosed with a benign tumor instead of a malignant one due to a faulty MRI machine at the Mayo Clinic.\n\n## Key Dependencies\n- **Pathology** \u2014 accurate tissue diagnosis is required for cancer treatment, and its absence can lead to incorrect treatment, such as the case of the patient who received unnecessary chemotherapy due to a misdiagnosed tumor at the University of California, San Francisco.\n- **Pharmacology** \u2014 understanding of drug interactions and side effects is necessary for safe cancer treatment, and its absence can lead to adverse reactions, such as the case of the patient who experienced severe neutropenia due to a drug interaction at the National Cancer Institute.\n- **Surgery** \u2014 surgical removal of tumors is often necessary for cancer treatment, and its absence can lead to tumor progression, such as the case of the patient who was not able to undergo surgery due to a lack of available operating rooms at the Johns Hopkins Hospital.\n- **Radiation Oncology** \u2014 radiation therapy is a common treatment for cancer, and its absence can lead to reduced treatment options, such as the case of the patient who was unable to receive radiation therapy due to a lack of available equipment at the MD Anderson Cancer Center.\n- **Hematology** \u2014 understanding of blood disorders is necessary for cancer treatment, and its absence can lead to incorrect diagnoses, such as the case of the patient who was misdiagnosed with a blood disorder instead of a blood cancer at the University of Chicago.\n\n## Priority Order\nThe dependencies can be ranked in the following order from most to least critical:\n- **Radiology**, as it is required for initial diagnosis and treatment planning\n- **Pathology**, as it is required for accurate tissue diagnosis\n- **Pharmacology**, as it is required for safe cancer treatment\n- **Surgery**, as it is often necessary for tumor removal\n- **Radiation Oncology**, as it is a common treatment for cancer\n- **Hematology**, as it is necessary for understanding of blood disorders, but not always directly related to cancer treatment, such as in the case of a patient with a solid tumor who does not require ongoing hematology care.\n\n## Common Gaps\nPeople often overlook the importance of **interdisciplinary communication**, assuming that healthcare professionals will automatically share information and coordinate care, but this can lead to errors and adverse events, such as the case of the patient who was prescribed a medication that interacted with their cancer treatment due to a lack of communication between their oncologist and primary care physician at the Cleveland Clinic.",
