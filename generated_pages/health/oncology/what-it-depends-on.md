# What Oncology Depends On

1. INTRODUCTION
Oncology is the branch of medicine that deals with the study, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer. It is a complex field that relies on various dependencies to function effectively. Understanding these dependencies is crucial for providing quality care to patients and advancing cancer research. The dependencies that oncology relies on are the foundation upon which the entire field is built, and without them, it would be impossible to make progress in cancer treatment and research.

2. KEY DEPENDENCIES
Oncology depends on several key factors, including:
- Basic sciences such as biology and chemistry: These sciences provide the underlying knowledge of how cells work, how cancer develops, and how treatments interact with the body. Without a strong foundation in basic sciences, oncologists would not be able to understand the mechanisms of cancer or develop effective treatments. 
- Advanced medical technology: This includes equipment such as MRI and CT scanners, which are necessary for diagnosing and monitoring cancer. Without advanced medical technology, doctors would not be able to accurately diagnose or track the progression of cancer.
- Clinical trials and research: These are essential for developing new treatments and testing their safety and effectiveness. Without clinical trials and research, new treatments would not be developed, and existing ones would not be improved.
- Multidisciplinary teams of healthcare professionals: Oncology requires collaboration among doctors, nurses, and other healthcare professionals to provide comprehensive care to patients. Without a team approach, patients may not receive the best possible care.
- Patient data and records: Accurate and up-to-date patient data is necessary for tracking patient outcomes, developing treatment plans, and making informed decisions. Without patient data and records, doctors would not be able to provide personalized care.

3. ORDER OF IMPORTANCE
While all the dependencies are crucial, some are more critical than others. Basic sciences such as biology and chemistry provide the foundation for understanding cancer and developing treatments. Advanced medical technology is also essential for diagnosis and treatment. Clinical trials and research are critical for developing new treatments, but they rely on the foundation provided by basic sciences and advanced medical technology. Multidisciplinary teams of healthcare professionals and patient data and records are also important, but they are built on top of the foundation provided by the other dependencies.

4. COMMON GAPS
One common gap in oncology is the assumption that new technologies and treatments can be developed without a strong foundation in basic sciences. Another gap is the lack of attention to the importance of multidisciplinary teams and patient data and records. Many people overlook the fact that oncology is a team effort that requires collaboration among many different healthcare professionals, and that accurate patient data is essential for providing high-quality care.

5. SUMMARY
In summary, oncology depends on a range of key factors, including basic sciences, advanced medical technology, clinical trials and research, multidisciplinary teams of healthcare professionals, and patient data and records. These dependencies are the foundation upon which the entire field of oncology is built, and they are essential for providing high-quality care to patients and advancing cancer research. By understanding these dependencies and their relationships to each other, we can better appreciate the complexity of oncology and the importance of a comprehensive approach to cancer care.
