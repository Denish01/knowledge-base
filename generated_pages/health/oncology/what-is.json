  "content": "## Definition\nOncology is the branch of medicine that deals with the study, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of cancer, with the term originating from the Greek words \"onkos\" meaning mass or tumor and \"logos\" meaning study, first coined by **Rudolf Virchow** in the 19th century.\n\n## How It Works\nOncology involves a multidisciplinary approach, incorporating **surgery**, **radiation therapy**, and **chemotherapy** to treat cancer. The treatment plan depends on the type and stage of cancer, with **staging** based on the **TNM system**, which considers the size of the tumor, spread to lymph nodes, and metastasis to other parts of the body. For example, **breast cancer** is staged from 0 to IV, with stage 0 being non-invasive and stage IV being metastatic, according to the **American Joint Committee on Cancer**.\n\nThe process of oncology also involves **cancer screening**, which aims to detect cancer at an early stage, when it is more treatable. Screening methods include **mammography** for breast cancer, **colonoscopy** for colorectal cancer, and **low-dose computed tomography** for lung cancer. The **United States Preventive Services Task Force** recommends regular screening for these cancers, with the frequency and starting age depending on individual risk factors. Additionally, **genetic testing** can identify individuals with a high risk of developing certain types of cancer, such as **BRCA1** and **BRCA2** for breast and ovarian cancer.\n\nOncology also encompasses **palliative care**, which focuses on alleviating the symptoms and stress of cancer, rather than treating the disease itself. **Hospice care** is a type of palliative care for patients with advanced cancer, providing emotional, social, and spiritual support. The **World Health Organization** estimates that approximately 18.1 million new cancer cases and 9.6 million cancer deaths occurred worldwide in 2018, highlighting the need for effective oncology care.\n\n## Key Components\n- **Tumor biology**: understanding the characteristics of cancer cells, such as their growth rate and ability to metastasize, is crucial for developing targeted therapies, with **angiogenesis inhibitors** being an example of a treatment that targets the formation of new blood vessels that feed the tumor.\n- **Imaging techniques**: **positron emission tomography** and **magnetic resonance imaging** are used to visualize the tumor and assess the effectiveness of treatment, with **response evaluation criteria in solid tumors** being a framework for measuring tumor response.\n- **Chemotherapeutic agents**: **anthracyclines** and **taxanes** are examples of chemotherapy drugs that target rapidly dividing cancer cells, with the **National Comprehensive Cancer Network** providing guidelines for their use.\n- **Immune system modulation**: **checkpoint inhibitors** and **cancer vaccines** are immunotherapies that enhance the body's natural defenses against cancer, with **pembrolizumab** being an example of a checkpoint inhibitor that has shown efficacy in treating **non-small cell lung cancer**.\n- **Clinical trials**: these studies evaluate the safety and efficacy of new cancer treatments, with **randomized controlled trials** being the gold standard for determining the effectiveness of a treatment, and **phases I-IV** representing the different stages of clinical trial development.\n- **Multidisciplinary care teams**: oncologists, surgeons, radiologists, and other healthcare professionals work together to provide comprehensive care for cancer patients, with **tumor boards** being a platform for discussing individual patient cases and developing treatment plans.\n\n## Common Misconceptions\n**Myth:** Cancer is a single disease \u2014 **Fact:** Cancer is a group of over 100 distinct diseases, each with its own unique characteristics and treatment approaches (National Cancer Institute).\n**Myth:** Cancer is always caused by genetic mutations \u2014 **Fact:** While genetic mutations can contribute to cancer development, environmental factors such as **tobacco use** and **ultraviolet radiation** also play a significant role (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).\n**Myth:** Cancer treatment always involves chemotherapy \u2014 **Fact:** Treatment plans depend on the type and stage of cancer, and may involve surgery, radiation therapy, or other approaches, such as **hormone therapy** for **prostate cancer** (American Cancer Society).\n**Myth:** Cancer is always fatal \u2014 **Fact:** Many types of cancer are treatable, and the **5-year survival rate** for all cancers combined has increased to 68.6% in the United States, according to the **Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results** program.\n\n## In Practice\nThe **University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center** is a leading institution in oncology care, with a comprehensive approach that includes **surgical oncology**, **radiation oncology**, and **medical oncology**. The center treats over 150,000 patients annually, with a focus on **personalized medicine** and **translational research**. For example, the center's **Lung Cancer Moon Shot** program aims to reduce lung cancer deaths by 25% in the next 5 years, with a budget of $25 million, and has already shown promising results with **nivolumab**, a checkpoint inhibitor that has improved survival rates for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.",
