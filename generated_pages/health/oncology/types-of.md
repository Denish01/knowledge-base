# Types of Oncology

There are three main categories of **Oncology**: medical, surgical, and radiation, each defined by its unique approach to cancer treatment. 
## Main Categories
- **Medical Oncology** — focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of cancer using pharmacological and hormonal therapies, as seen in the work of the **National Cancer Institute**, which develops and tests new cancer treatments.
- **Surgical Oncology** — involves the surgical removal of tumors and cancerous tissues, with **Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center** being a prominent example of a hospital that specializes in surgical oncology procedures.
- **Radiation Oncology** — utilizes high-energy radiation to kill cancer cells, as employed by the **University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center**, which offers advanced radiation therapy treatments.

## Comparison Table
| Category | Treatment Approach | Cost | Risk |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Medical Oncology | Pharmacological and hormonal therapies | High (e.g., ~$100,000 per year for some targeted therapies, National Cancer Institute) | Moderate (e.g., side effects from chemotherapy) |
| Surgical Oncology | Surgical removal of tumors | High (e.g., ~$50,000 for a surgical procedure, American Cancer Society) | High (e.g., risks associated with surgery) |
| Radiation Oncology | High-energy radiation | Moderate (e.g., ~$10,000 per treatment course, American Society for Radiation Oncology) | Low (e.g., non-invasive) |

## How They Relate
The categories of oncology often overlap, with patients receiving treatment from multiple specialties, such as **medical oncologists** and **radiation oncologists** working together to develop a comprehensive treatment plan, as seen in the **Cancer Treatment Centers of America**. Specifically, **surgical oncology** and **medical oncology** may be used in conjunction, with surgery removing the primary tumor and medical oncology treating any remaining cancer cells, as in the case of **breast cancer** treatment at **Dana-Farber Cancer Institute**. Additionally, **radiation oncology** may be used in combination with **surgical oncology**, with radiation therapy used to shrink tumors before surgery, as seen in the treatment of **lung cancer** at **Massachusetts General Hospital**.
