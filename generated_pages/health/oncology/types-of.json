  "content": "There are three main categories of **Oncology**: medical, surgical, and radiation, each defined by its unique approach to cancer treatment. \n## Main Categories\n- **Medical Oncology** \u2014 focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of cancer using pharmacological and hormonal therapies, as seen in the work of the **National Cancer Institute**, which develops and tests new cancer treatments.\n- **Surgical Oncology** \u2014 involves the surgical removal of tumors and cancerous tissues, with **Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center** being a prominent example of a hospital that specializes in surgical oncology procedures.\n- **Radiation Oncology** \u2014 utilizes high-energy radiation to kill cancer cells, as employed by the **University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center**, which offers advanced radiation therapy treatments.\n\n## Comparison Table\n| Category | Treatment Approach | Cost | Risk |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Medical Oncology | Pharmacological and hormonal therapies | High (e.g., ~$100,000 per year for some targeted therapies, National Cancer Institute) | Moderate (e.g., side effects from chemotherapy) |\n| Surgical Oncology | Surgical removal of tumors | High (e.g., ~$50,000 for a surgical procedure, American Cancer Society) | High (e.g., risks associated with surgery) |\n| Radiation Oncology | High-energy radiation | Moderate (e.g., ~$10,000 per treatment course, American Society for Radiation Oncology) | Low (e.g., non-invasive) |\n\n## How They Relate\nThe categories of oncology often overlap, with patients receiving treatment from multiple specialties, such as **medical oncologists** and **radiation oncologists** working together to develop a comprehensive treatment plan, as seen in the **Cancer Treatment Centers of America**. Specifically, **surgical oncology** and **medical oncology** may be used in conjunction, with surgery removing the primary tumor and medical oncology treating any remaining cancer cells, as in the case of **breast cancer** treatment at **Dana-Farber Cancer Institute**. Additionally, **radiation oncology** may be used in combination with **surgical oncology**, with radiation therapy used to shrink tumors before surgery, as seen in the treatment of **lung cancer** at **Massachusetts General Hospital**.",
