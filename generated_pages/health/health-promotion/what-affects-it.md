# What Affects Health Promotion

Socioeconomic status is the single biggest factor affecting health promotion, as it **increases** access to healthcare, healthy food, and safe living environments, with the World Health Organization estimating that people in the highest socioeconomic group live 7-10 years longer than those in the lowest group (World Health Organization).

## Main Factors
- **Education** — improves health literacy, **increases** healthy behaviors, and **decreases** health risks, with a study by the National Center for Education Statistics showing that adults with a bachelor's degree or higher have a 24% lower risk of obesity compared to those without a high school diploma (National Center for Education Statistics).
- **Income** — **increases** access to healthcare, healthy food, and safe living environments, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reporting that the median household income for adults with excellent or very good health is $73,000, compared to $43,000 for those with fair or poor health (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).
- **Environmental factors** — **decrease** health risks when living in areas with clean air, water, and sanitation, with the Environmental Protection Agency estimating that every dollar invested in clean water infrastructure returns approximately $3 in economic benefits (Environmental Protection Agency).
- **Access to healthcare** — **increases** health outcomes, **decreases** health disparities, and **increases** patient satisfaction, with the Commonwealth Fund reporting that countries with universal healthcare systems have better health outcomes and lower healthcare costs, such as Japan, which spends 11% of its GDP on healthcare compared to the US, which spends 18% (Commonwealth Fund).
- **Social support** — **increases** mental health, **decreases** stress, and **increases** healthy behaviors, with the American Psychological Association finding that people with strong social connections have a 50% increased chance of survival over a 7.5-year period (American Psychological Association).
- **Physical activity** — **increases** physical health, **decreases** chronic disease risk, and **increases** mental health, with the World Health Organization recommending at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity per week, which can reduce the risk of heart disease by 35% (World Health Organization).
- **Nutrition** — **increases** health outcomes, **decreases** chronic disease risk, and **increases** energy levels, with the United States Department of Agriculture estimating that a healthy diet can reduce healthcare costs by $71 billion annually (United States Department of Agriculture).

## How They Interact
The interaction between **education** and **income** can amplify health promotion, as higher education levels often lead to higher incomes, which in turn increase access to healthcare and healthy living environments. For example, a study by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that every additional year of education **increases** earnings by 10%, which can lead to better health outcomes (National Bureau of Economic Research). The interaction between **environmental factors** and **access to healthcare** can also amplify health promotion, as living in areas with clean air, water, and sanitation can reduce the need for healthcare services, while access to healthcare can improve health outcomes in areas with poor environmental conditions. The interaction between **social support** and **physical activity** can also amplify health promotion, as social support can encourage physical activity, which in turn can improve mental and physical health.

## Controllable vs Uncontrollable
The controllable factors are **education**, **income**, **access to healthcare**, **social support**, **physical activity**, and **nutrition**, which can be controlled by individuals, communities, and policymakers. For example, individuals can pursue higher education, while policymakers can implement policies to increase access to healthcare and healthy living environments. The uncontrollable factors are **environmental factors**, which can be influenced by policymakers and individuals, but are often shaped by broader societal and economic trends. However, individuals and communities can still take action to mitigate the negative effects of environmental factors, such as by using public transportation or carpooling, which can reduce air pollution by 20% (Environmental Protection Agency).
