# What Health Promotion Depends On

1. INTRODUCTION:
Health promotion is the process of enabling people to increase control over and improve their health. It involves activities that promote healthy behaviors, create supportive environments, and strengthen community action. Understanding what health promotion depends on is crucial because it highlights the prerequisites and foundations necessary for effective health promotion. Without these dependencies, health promotion efforts may be unsuccessful or even counterproductive.

2. KEY DEPENDENCIES:
- The dependency: Access to accurate health information
  Why it's necessary: Accurate health information is necessary to make informed decisions about health behaviors and to develop effective health promotion strategies.
  What happens without it: Without access to accurate health information, people may rely on misinformation, leading to unhealthy behaviors and poor health outcomes.
- The dependency: Community engagement and participation
  Why it's necessary: Community engagement and participation are necessary to ensure that health promotion efforts are relevant, effective, and sustainable.
  What happens without it: Without community engagement and participation, health promotion efforts may be met with resistance or disinterest, leading to poor outcomes.
- The dependency: Availability of resources and funding
  Why it's necessary: Availability of resources and funding is necessary to support health promotion activities, such as education, outreach, and program development.
  What happens without it: Without sufficient resources and funding, health promotion efforts may be limited or ineffective, leading to poor health outcomes.
- The dependency: Supportive policies and environments
  Why it's necessary: Supportive policies and environments are necessary to create an ecosystem that promotes healthy behaviors and supports health promotion efforts.
  What happens without it: Without supportive policies and environments, health promotion efforts may be hindered or undermined, leading to poor health outcomes.
- The dependency: Trained and skilled health professionals
  Why it's necessary: Trained and skilled health professionals are necessary to develop, implement, and evaluate health promotion strategies.
  What happens without it: Without trained and skilled health professionals, health promotion efforts may be ineffective or even harmful, leading to poor health outcomes.

3. ORDER OF IMPORTANCE:
While all dependencies are crucial, access to accurate health information and community engagement and participation are most critical. These two dependencies lay the foundation for all other health promotion efforts. Without them, health promotion strategies may be misguided or ineffective. Availability of resources and funding, supportive policies and environments, and trained and skilled health professionals are also essential, but they build upon the foundation established by accurate health information and community engagement.

4. COMMON GAPS:
People often overlook or assume that community engagement and participation will occur naturally, without effort or investment. They may also assume that accurate health information is readily available and accessible to all, without considering barriers such as language, literacy, or cultural differences. Additionally, people may underestimate the importance of supportive policies and environments in promoting healthy behaviors.

5. SUMMARY:
The essential foundation for health promotion is built upon several key dependencies, including access to accurate health information, community engagement and participation, availability of resources and funding, supportive policies and environments, and trained and skilled health professionals. Understanding and addressing these dependencies is critical to developing effective health promotion strategies that promote healthy behaviors and improve health outcomes. By recognizing the importance of these prerequisites, health promotion efforts can be tailored to meet the unique needs of individuals and communities, ultimately leading to better health and well-being.
