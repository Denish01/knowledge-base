# What Health Promotion Depends On

Health promotion depends on **Financial Resources**, as a lack of funding can severely limit the scope and effectiveness of health promotion initiatives, such as the failed implementation of a national health education program in Zambia due to insufficient funding, which resulted in a significant decrease in health awareness and preventative care.

## Key Dependencies
- **Financial Resources** — without sufficient funding, health promotion initiatives are often under-resourced and ineffective, as seen in the case of Zambia's national health education program, which failed to achieve its goals due to lack of funds.
- **Community Engagement** — health promotion relies on the active participation of the community, and without it, initiatives can be met with resistance or disinterest, such as the failed introduction of a vaccination program in Nigeria, where local leaders and community members were not adequately engaged, leading to widespread mistrust and low vaccination rates.
- **Healthcare Infrastructure** — a well-functioning healthcare system is necessary to support health promotion efforts, and its absence can render even the best-designed initiatives ineffective, as seen in the case of Haiti, where a lack of healthcare infrastructure hindered the response to the 2010 cholera outbreak.
- **Education and Awareness** — health promotion requires a basic level of understanding and awareness among the target population, and without it, messages can be misunderstood or ignored, such as the failed anti-smoking campaign in Indonesia, where the target audience was not adequately educated about the risks of smoking.
- **Policy Support** — health promotion initiatives need to be supported by policies that create an environment conducive to healthy behaviors, and without such policies, initiatives can be undermined or even counterproductive, such as the failed attempt to promote physical activity in the United States, where urban planning policies often prioritize car-friendly infrastructure over pedestrian-friendly design.
- **Cultural Sensitivity** — health promotion initiatives must be tailored to the cultural context in which they are implemented, and without cultural sensitivity, initiatives can be ineffective or even offensive, such as the failed introduction of a family planning program in rural India, where the messaging and materials were not adapted to local cultural norms.

## Priority Order
The dependencies can be ranked in order of priority as follows:
- **Financial Resources**, as without funding, no initiative can be implemented, and the case of Zambia's national health education program demonstrates the consequences of underfunding.
- **Healthcare Infrastructure**, as a functional healthcare system is necessary to support health promotion efforts, and the example of Haiti's response to the cholera outbreak shows the importance of a well-functioning healthcare system.
- **Community Engagement**, as community participation is crucial for the success of health promotion initiatives, and the failed introduction of a vaccination program in Nigeria highlights the importance of engaging local leaders and community members.
- **Education and Awareness**, as a basic level of understanding is necessary for health promotion messages to be effective, and the failed anti-smoking campaign in Indonesia demonstrates the importance of educating the target audience.
- **Policy Support**, as policies can create an environment that supports or undermines health promotion initiatives, and the failed attempt to promote physical activity in the United States shows the importance of policy support.
- **Cultural Sensitivity**, as cultural sensitivity is necessary to ensure that health promotion initiatives are effective and respectful, and the failed introduction of a family planning program in rural India highlights the importance of adapting initiatives to local cultural norms.

## Common Gaps
One common assumption that people overlook is that **health promotion can be implemented in a one-size-fits-all manner**, which can lead to initiatives being ineffective or even counterproductive in certain contexts. For example, a health promotion initiative that is successful in an urban setting may not be effective in a rural setting, where access to healthcare and education may be limited. This assumption can cause initiatives to fail, as seen in the case of the failed introduction of a vaccination program in Nigeria, where the initiative was not adapted to the local context.
