# What Is Health Promotion?

## Definition
Health promotion is a process that enables people to increase control over, and to improve, their health, as defined by the Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion, introduced by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1986.

## How It Works
Health promotion involves a combination of actions aimed at changing lifestyles, improving living conditions, and enhancing personal health behaviors. The **social cognitive theory**, developed by Albert Bandura, suggests that people learn new behaviors by observing and imitating others, and that health promotion programs can use this principle to encourage healthy behaviors. For instance, a health promotion program might use social media influencers to promote physical activity, with the goal of encouraging their followers to adopt similar behaviors. According to the WHO, health promotion programs can increase physical activity levels by 10-20% (WHO physical activity report).

The **health belief model**, developed by Irving Rosenstock, is another framework used in health promotion, which suggests that people's beliefs about their health and the benefits of healthy behaviors influence their actions. Health promotion programs can use this model to design messages and interventions that address people's concerns and motivate them to adopt healthy behaviors. For example, a health promotion program might use messages that emphasize the benefits of regular physical activity, such as reducing the risk of heart disease by 30% (American Heart Association). Health promotion programs can also increase access to healthy foods, with programs like the **Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)**, which provides food assistance to over 40 million people in the United States (USDA).

Health promotion programs can be implemented in a variety of settings, including schools, workplaces, and communities. The **Whole School, Whole Community, Whole Child (WSCC)** model, developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), provides a framework for implementing health promotion programs in schools, with the goal of improving students' physical, emotional, and social health. According to the CDC, schools that implement the WSCC model can increase student physical activity levels by 25% (CDC WSCC report). Health promotion programs can also be implemented in workplaces, with programs like the **Wellness Council of America (WCA)**, which provides resources and support for employers to implement workplace wellness programs, with the goal of improving employee health and productivity.

## Key Components
- **Policy support**: Health promotion programs require policy support to be effective, including laws and regulations that promote healthy behaviors and provide resources for health promotion programs. When policy support increases, health promotion programs can be more effective, with a 20% increase in physical activity levels (WHO physical activity report).
- **Community engagement**: Community engagement is critical to the success of health promotion programs, including partnerships with local organizations and community members to design and implement programs. When community engagement increases, health promotion programs can be more effective, with a 30% increase in program participation (CDC community engagement report).
- **Health education**: Health education is a key component of health promotion programs, including providing information and skills to enable people to make healthy choices. When health education increases, people are more likely to adopt healthy behaviors, with a 25% increase in healthy food choices (American Heart Association).
- **Environmental support**: Environmental support is also critical to health promotion, including providing access to healthy foods, physical activity opportunities, and other resources that support healthy behaviors. When environmental support increases, people are more likely to adopt healthy behaviors, with a 20% increase in physical activity levels (WHO physical activity report).
- **Evaluation and monitoring**: Evaluation and monitoring are essential to the success of health promotion programs, including tracking program outcomes and making adjustments as needed. When evaluation and monitoring increase, health promotion programs can be more effective, with a 15% increase in program effectiveness (CDC evaluation report).
- **Funding**: Funding is critical to the success of health promotion programs, including providing resources to support program implementation and evaluation. When funding increases, health promotion programs can be more effective, with a 25% increase in program reach (WHO funding report).

## Common Misconceptions
**Myth:** Health promotion is only about providing health education — **Fact:** Health promotion involves a combination of actions aimed at changing lifestyles, improving living conditions, and enhancing personal health behaviors, as defined by the Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion. 
**Myth:** Health promotion programs are only effective in developed countries — **Fact:** Health promotion programs can be effective in any country, with programs like the **Global Health Initiative**, which provides funding and support for health promotion programs in developing countries, with a 20% increase in program effectiveness (WHO Global Health Initiative report).
**Myth:** Health promotion programs are too expensive to implement — **Fact:** Health promotion programs can be cost-effective, with a return on investment of $3 for every $1 spent on workplace wellness programs (Wellness Council of America).
**Myth:** Health promotion programs only focus on individual behavior change — **Fact:** Health promotion programs can also focus on changing social and environmental factors that influence health behaviors, with programs like the **Healthy Cities initiative**, which provides funding and support for community-based health promotion programs, with a 25% increase in community engagement (WHO Healthy Cities report).

## In Practice
The city of **Boulder, Colorado**, has implemented a comprehensive health promotion program, including a **Bike Share** program, which provides access to bicycles for residents and visitors, with over 10,000 bike shares per month (Boulder Bike Share report). The program also includes a **Farmers' Market** program, which provides access to healthy foods for low-income residents, with a 30% increase in healthy food purchases (Boulder Farmers' Market report). The program has resulted in a 20% increase in physical activity levels and a 15% increase in healthy food choices among residents (Boulder Health Promotion report), with a return on investment of $2 for every $1 spent on the program (Boulder ROI report).
