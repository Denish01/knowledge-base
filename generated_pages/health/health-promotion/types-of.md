# Types of Health Promotion

There are five main categories of health promotion, organized around the level of individual and community involvement: **Health Education**, **Health Protection**, **Preventive Health Services**, **Health Promotion Programs**, and **Community Development**. 

## Main Categories
- **Health Education** — focuses on providing individuals with the knowledge and skills necessary to make informed decisions about their health, as seen in the **American Heart Association's** Heart-Healthy Eating Plate campaign, which aims to educate people about healthy eating habits.
- **Health Protection** — involves measures to protect people from health hazards, such as the **Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA)** standards for workplace safety, which require employers to provide a safe working environment for employees.
- **Preventive Health Services** — provides services aimed at preventing disease and promoting health, including regular check-ups and screenings, as offered by the **National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program**, which provides breast and cervical cancer screenings to low-income women.
- **Health Promotion Programs** — designed to encourage healthy behaviors and lifestyles, such as the **Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC)** Diabetes Prevention Program, which provides a lifestyle change program for people with prediabetes.
- **Community Development** — involves working with communities to identify and address health needs, as seen in the **World Health Organization's (WHO)** Healthy Cities initiative, which supports cities in creating healthy and sustainable environments.

## Comparison Table
| Category | Cost | Scale | Speed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Health Education** | Low-Moderate (e.g., $100-$1,000 per campaign) | Individual-Community | Medium (e.g., 6-12 months per campaign) |
| **Health Protection** | Moderate-High (e.g., $1,000-$10,000 per regulation) | Population-Based | Fast (e.g., immediate implementation of regulations) |
| **Preventive Health Services** | Moderate (e.g., $500-$5,000 per service) | Individual-Community | Medium (e.g., 3-6 months per service) |
| **Health Promotion Programs** | Moderate-High (e.g., $5,000-$50,000 per program) | Community-Population | Slow (e.g., 1-2 years per program) |
| **Community Development** | High (e.g., $50,000-$500,000 per project) | Community-Population | Slow (e.g., 2-5 years per project) |

## How They Relate
The categories of health promotion often overlap and feed into each other, such as **Health Education** and **Health Promotion Programs**, which both aim to encourage healthy behaviors, but differ in their approach, with **Health Education** focusing on providing information and **Health Promotion Programs** focusing on providing support and resources. 
- **Health Protection** and **Preventive Health Services** are often confused, but **Health Protection** focuses on protecting people from health hazards, while **Preventive Health Services** focuses on preventing disease and promoting health.
- **Community Development** and **Health Promotion Programs** are closely related, as **Community Development** provides the foundation for **Health Promotion Programs** by creating a supportive environment for healthy behaviors.
- The **American Cancer Society** and **American Heart Association** are examples of organizations that provide **Health Education**, **Health Promotion Programs**, and **Preventive Health Services**, demonstrating the interconnectedness of these categories.
