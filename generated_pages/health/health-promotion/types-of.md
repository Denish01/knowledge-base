INTRODUCTION
Health promotion is a vital aspect of healthcare that involves activities and initiatives aimed at improving the overall well-being of individuals and communities. The classification of health promotion types is essential as it helps in understanding the various approaches, methods, and strategies used to promote health. By categorizing health promotion types, healthcare professionals and organizations can better plan, implement, and evaluate their health promotion initiatives. This classification system covers the different types of health promotion, including their definitions, characteristics, and examples, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding the various approaches to promoting health.
