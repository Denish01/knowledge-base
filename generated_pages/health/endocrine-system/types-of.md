# Types of Endocrine System

There are nine distinct categories of endocrine systems, organized by their functional role in regulating bodily processes. 
## Main Categories
- **Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis** — a complex neuroendocrine system that regulates the body's response to stress, characterized by the interaction between the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, and adrenal glands, as seen in the response to cortisol produced by the adrenal glands in humans.
- **Thyroid Axis** — a system that regulates metabolism, characterized by the production of thyroid hormones by the thyroid gland, with the thyroid gland in humans being a primary example.
- **Gonadal Axis** — a system that regulates reproductive processes, characterized by the production of sex hormones by the gonads, such as the ovaries in female humans producing estrogen.
- **Adrenal Axis** — a system that regulates electrolyte balance and stress response, characterized by the production of aldosterone and cortisol by the adrenal glands, as seen in the adrenal glands of humans producing aldosterone to regulate sodium levels.
- **Pancreatic Axis** — a system that regulates glucose metabolism, characterized by the production of insulin and glucagon by the pancreas, with the pancreas in humans being a primary example.
- **Pineal Axis** — a system that regulates circadian rhythms, characterized by the production of melatonin by the pineal gland, as seen in the pineal gland of humans producing melatonin to regulate sleep-wake cycles.
- **Parathyroid Axis** — a system that regulates calcium homeostasis, characterized by the production of parathyroid hormone by the parathyroid glands, with the parathyroid glands in humans being a primary example.
- **Gastroenteropancreatic Axis** — a system that regulates digestion and glucose metabolism, characterized by the production of gastrointestinal hormones by the stomach, small intestine, and pancreas, such as the production of gastrin by the stomach in humans.
- **Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS)** — a system that regulates blood pressure and electrolyte balance, characterized by the interaction between the kidneys, lungs, and adrenal glands, as seen in the regulation of blood pressure in humans through the production of angiotensin II.

## Comparison Table
| Category | Primary Function | Key Hormones | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| HPA Axis | Stress response | Cortisol, adrenaline | Human adrenal glands |
| Thyroid Axis | Metabolism | Thyroid hormones | Human thyroid gland |
| Gonadal Axis | Reproduction | Sex hormones | Human ovaries |
| Adrenal Axis | Electrolyte balance, stress response | Aldosterone, cortisol | Human adrenal glands |
| Pancreatic Axis | Glucose metabolism | Insulin, glucagon | Human pancreas |
| Pineal Axis | Circadian rhythms | Melatonin | Human pineal gland |
| Parathyroid Axis | Calcium homeostasis | Parathyroid hormone | Human parathyroid glands |
| Gastroenteropancreatic Axis | Digestion, glucose metabolism | Gastrointestinal hormones | Human stomach, small intestine, pancreas |
| RAAS | Blood pressure, electrolyte balance | Angiotensin II, aldosterone | Human kidneys, lungs, adrenal glands |

## How They Relate
The **HPA Axis** and **Adrenal Axis** overlap in their regulation of stress response and electrolyte balance, with the HPA Axis stimulating the production of cortisol by the adrenal glands. The **Thyroid Axis** and **Gonadal Axis** are related in their regulation of growth and development, with thyroid hormones influencing the production of sex hormones. The **Pancreatic Axis** and **Gastroenteropancreatic Axis** are closely related in their regulation of glucose metabolism, with the pancreas producing insulin and glucagon in response to gastrointestinal hormones. The **RAAS** and **Adrenal Axis** are also related, as the RAAS stimulates the production of aldosterone by the adrenal glands to regulate electrolyte balance and blood pressure.
