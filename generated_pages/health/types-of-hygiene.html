        <p>1. INTRODUCTION:</p>
<p>Types of hygiene refer to the various practices and methods used to maintain cleanliness and prevent the spread of diseases. Classification of hygiene types is essential as it helps individuals understand the different aspects of hygiene and implement them effectively in their daily lives. By categorizing hygiene into distinct types, individuals can better comprehend the importance of each type and take necessary measures to maintain overall health and well-being. This classification system enables individuals to identify areas that require attention and make informed decisions about their hygiene practices.</p>

<p>2. MAIN CATEGORIES:</p>
<p>The following are the primary types of hygiene, each with its unique characteristics and examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Personal Hygiene</strong>: Personal hygiene refers to the practices and habits that individuals adopt to maintain their own cleanliness and health. Key characteristics include regular bathing, brushing teeth, and washing hands. For example, brushing teeth at least twice a day is a fundamental aspect of personal hygiene.</li>
  <li><strong>Environmental Hygiene</strong>: Environmental hygiene involves the practices and methods used to maintain a clean and healthy environment. Key characteristics include proper waste disposal, cleaning surfaces, and maintaining ventilation. For instance, regularly cleaning and disinfecting kitchen counters is an example of environmental hygiene.</li>
  <li><strong>Food Hygiene</strong>: Food hygiene refers to the practices and methods used to handle, prepare, and store food safely. Key characteristics include proper hand washing, separating raw and cooked foods, and cooking food to the recommended temperature. A simple example of food hygiene is washing hands before handling food.</li>
  <li><strong>Medical Hygiene</strong>: Medical hygiene involves the practices and methods used to prevent the spread of diseases in medical settings. Key characteristics include sterilizing equipment, wearing gloves, and following proper hand washing protocols. For example, healthcare professionals wearing gloves when treating patients is a crucial aspect of medical hygiene.</li>
  <li><strong>Dental Hygiene</strong>: Dental hygiene refers to the practices and methods used to maintain the health and cleanliness of teeth and gums. Key characteristics include regular brushing, flossing, and dental check-ups. A simple example of dental hygiene is flossing teeth once a day.</li>
