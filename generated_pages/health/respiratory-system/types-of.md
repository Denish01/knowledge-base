# Types of Respiratory System

There are six main categories of respiratory systems, organized by their structural and functional characteristics. 
## Main Categories
The **Upper Respiratory System** — responsible for air intake and filtration, distinguished by the presence of the nose, mouth, and throat, and exemplified by the human upper respiratory system which includes the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. 
The **Lower Respiratory System** — involved in gas exchange and absorption of oxygen, characterized by the trachea, bronchi, and lungs, and illustrated by the canine lower respiratory system which includes the diaphragm and bronchioles. 
The **Pulmonary Respiratory System** — focused on the lungs and their role in exchanging oxygen and carbon dioxide, marked by the presence of alveoli and the pulmonary capillaries, and demonstrated by the feline pulmonary system which features a high concentration of type I pneumocytes. 
The **Buccal Respiratory System** — used by some animals to breathe through their mouth, distinguished by the presence of a buccal cavity and gills, and shown by the buccal respiratory system of the African lungfish which can absorb oxygen from both water and air. 
The **Cutaneous Respiratory System** — allows some animals to breathe through their skin, characterized by the presence of skin folds and a thin epidermis, and exemplified by the cutaneous respiratory system of the American bullfrog which can absorb oxygen directly from the water. 
The **Book Lung Respiratory System** — found in some arachnids and allows for gas exchange through thin flaps of tissue, distinguished by the presence of book lungs and a closed circulatory system, and illustrated by the book lung respiratory system of the tarantula which features four pairs of book lungs.

## Comparison Table
| Category | Complexity | Oxygen Absorption Efficiency | Example Species |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Upper Respiratory System | High | Low | Human |
| Lower Respiratory System | High | High | Canine |
| Pulmonary Respiratory System | High | High | Feline |
| Buccal Respiratory System | Low | Low | African Lungfish |
| Cutaneous Respiratory System | Low | Low | American Bullfrog |
| Book Lung Respiratory System | Medium | Medium | Tarantula |

## How They Relate
The **Upper** and **Lower Respiratory Systems** are commonly confused due to their interconnectedness, but the upper system is primarily responsible for air intake and filtration, while the lower system is involved in gas exchange. 
- The **Pulmonary** and **Cutaneous Respiratory Systems** overlap in some species, such as the African clawed frog, which can absorb oxygen through both its lungs and skin.
- The **Buccal** and **Book Lung Respiratory Systems** are distinct and found in different taxonomic groups, with the buccal system being used by some fish and the book lung system being used by some arachnids.
- The **Upper Respiratory System** feeds into the **Lower Respiratory System**, as inhaled air passes through the upper system before reaching the lungs.
- The **Pulmonary Respiratory System** can be affected by the **Upper Respiratory System**, as conditions such as chronic rhinitis can impact lung function.
