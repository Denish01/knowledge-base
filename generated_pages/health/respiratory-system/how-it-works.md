# How Respiratory System Works

The respiratory system works through a complex mechanism involving the **lungs**, **airways**, and **breathing muscles**, which together facilitate the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the atmosphere and the body. This process involves the inhalation of air, which contains approximately 21% oxygen, and the exhalation of air, which contains approximately 16% oxygen and 4% carbon dioxide.

## The Mechanism
The core cause-and-effect chain of the respiratory system involves the contraction and relaxation of the **diaphragm**, which creates a pressure gradient that draws air into the lungs, allowing for gas exchange to occur. The inputs to this system include atmospheric air, which is rich in oxygen, and the outputs include oxygenated blood and exhaled air, which is rich in carbon dioxide.

## Step-by-Step
1. The process begins with the contraction of the **diaphragm**, which increases the volume of the thoracic cavity by approximately 500 milliliters, creating a negative pressure gradient that draws air into the lungs. This contraction is caused by the stimulation of the **phrenic nerve**, which innervates the diaphragm, and results in an increase in lung volume and a decrease in intrapulmonary pressure.
2. As the air enters the lungs, it passes through the **trachea**, which divides into the **bronchi**, and then into the **bronchioles**, where gas exchange occurs. The diameter of the bronchioles is approximately 1 millimeter, and they are lined with **cilia**, which help to remove debris and mucus from the airways.
3. The air then reaches the **alveoli**, which are small sacs surrounded by a network of **capillaries**, where the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide occurs. The surface area of the alveoli is approximately 140 square meters, and the thickness of the alveolar-capillary membrane is approximately 0.5 micrometers, allowing for efficient gas exchange.
4. The oxygen from the inhaled air diffuses into the blood, binding to **hemoglobin** molecules in the red blood cells, while the carbon dioxide diffuses out of the blood and into the alveoli. The partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli is approximately 100 millimeters of mercury, and the partial pressure of carbon dioxide is approximately 40 millimeters of mercury.
5. The oxygen-rich blood is then transported to the body's tissues, where it is used for cellular respiration, while the carbon dioxide-rich blood is transported back to the lungs, where it is exhaled. The cardiac output, which is the volume of blood pumped by the heart per minute, is approximately 5 liters per minute, and the respiratory rate, which is the number of breaths per minute, is approximately 12-20 breaths per minute.
6. The exhalation of air is facilitated by the relaxation of the **diaphragm**, which decreases the volume of the thoracic cavity, creating a positive pressure gradient that pushes air out of the lungs. This relaxation is caused by the decrease in stimulation of the **phrenic nerve**, and results in a decrease in lung volume and an increase in intrapulmonary pressure.

## Key Components
- **Lungs**: The lungs are the primary organs of the respiratory system, responsible for gas exchange. If the lungs are damaged or diseased, gas exchange is impaired, leading to respiratory failure.
- **Diaphragm**: The diaphragm is the primary muscle of respiration, responsible for creating the pressure gradient that draws air into the lungs. If the diaphragm is paralyzed or weakened, breathing is impaired, leading to respiratory failure.
- **Airways**: The airways, including the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles, are responsible for conducting air to the lungs. If the airways are obstructed or inflamed, breathing is impaired, leading to respiratory distress.
- **Breathing muscles**: The breathing muscles, including the intercostal muscles and the accessory muscles, are responsible for assisting the diaphragm in creating the pressure gradient that draws air into the lungs. If the breathing muscles are weakened or paralyzed, breathing is impaired, leading to respiratory failure.

## Common Questions
What happens if the **diaphragm** is paralyzed? If the diaphragm is paralyzed, breathing is severely impaired, and the individual may require mechanical ventilation to survive. The **phrenic nerve**, which innervates the diaphragm, can be damaged due to injury or disease, leading to diaphragmatic paralysis.
What is the function of the **alveoli**? The alveoli are small sacs surrounded by a network of capillaries, where the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide occurs. The surface area of the alveoli is approximately 140 square meters, allowing for efficient gas exchange.
What happens if the **airways** are obstructed? If the airways are obstructed, breathing is impaired, leading to respiratory distress. The obstruction can be caused by debris, mucus, or inflammation, and can be treated with medications or mechanical ventilation.
What is the role of **hemoglobin** in the respiratory system? Hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells that binds to oxygen, allowing it to be transported to the body's tissues. The binding of oxygen to hemoglobin is a critical step in the respiratory process, and is essential for cellular respiration.
