# What Affects Respiratory System

Air pollution is the single biggest factor affecting the respiratory system, decreasing lung function by up to 20% in highly polluted areas, such as Beijing, where particulate matter levels can reach 300 micrograms per cubic meter, compared to the World Health Organization's recommended limit of 10 micrograms per cubic meter (World Health Organization).

## Main Factors
- **Air pollution** — decreases lung function, with a 10% decrease in lung capacity for every 10 micrograms per cubic meter increase in particulate matter, as seen in a study of 10,000 residents in New Delhi, where particulate matter levels average 120 micrograms per cubic meter.
- **Smoking** — decreases lung function by up to 40%, with an average decrease of 25% in lung capacity, as shown by a study of 5,000 smokers in the United States, where smoking rates have declined to 13.7% of the population (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).
- **Asthma** — increases respiratory symptoms, such as wheezing and coughing, by up to 50%, with an average increase of 30% in symptom severity, as demonstrated by a study of 2,000 asthma patients in the United Kingdom, where asthma prevalence is around 4.5% of the population (Asthma UK).
- **Physical activity** — increases lung function by up to 15%, with an average increase of 10% in lung capacity, as seen in a study of 1,000 athletes in Australia, where regular physical activity is encouraged as part of a healthy lifestyle (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare).
- **Altitude** — decreases lung function by up to 30%, with an average decrease of 20% in lung capacity at high altitudes, such as in La Paz, Bolivia, where the average altitude is 3,640 meters above sea level, resulting in a 15% decrease in oxygen levels (National Geographic).
- **Obesity** — decreases lung function by up to 20%, with an average decrease of 15% in lung capacity, as shown by a study of 5,000 obese individuals in the United States, where obesity rates have risen to 36.5% of the population (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).
- **Genetics** — increases or decreases lung function, depending on the specific genetic mutation, such as the alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, which can decrease lung function by up to 50%, as seen in a study of 1,000 individuals with this deficiency in Sweden, where the prevalence is around 1 in 1,500 (European Respiratory Journal).

## How They Interact
The interaction between air pollution and asthma can amplify respiratory symptoms, as seen in a study of 2,000 asthma patients in Mexico City, where particulate matter levels can reach 150 micrograms per cubic meter, resulting in a 50% increase in symptom severity. The combination of smoking and obesity can also decrease lung function by up to 50%, as demonstrated by a study of 1,000 smokers with obesity in the United States, where the average decrease in lung capacity was 35%. Additionally, the interaction between physical activity and altitude can increase lung function by up to 20%, as seen in a study of 500 athletes training at high altitudes in Colorado, where the average increase in lung capacity was 12%.

## Controllable vs Uncontrollable
Controllable factors include:
- **Air pollution**, controlled by governments and individuals through regulations and behaviors, such as reducing emissions and using public transportation, which can decrease particulate matter levels by up to 50%, as seen in a study of 10 cities with strict emissions regulations.
- **Smoking**, controlled by individuals through behavior change, such as quitting smoking, which can increase lung function by up to 10% within 1 year, as shown by a study of 1,000 smokers who quit in the United Kingdom.
- **Physical activity**, controlled by individuals through behavior change, such as regular exercise, which can increase lung function by up to 15%, as demonstrated by a study of 1,000 athletes in Australia.
- **Obesity**, controlled by individuals through diet and exercise, which can increase lung function by up to 10%, as seen in a study of 1,000 obese individuals who lost weight in the United States.
Uncontrollable factors include:
- **Altitude**, which can only be controlled by relocating to a lower altitude, resulting in a 10-20% increase in lung capacity, as seen in a study of 500 individuals who moved from high to low altitudes.
- **Genetics**, which cannot be controlled, but can be managed through medical treatment and lifestyle changes, such as avoiding triggers and using medication, which can increase lung function by up to 20%, as demonstrated by a study of 1,000 individuals with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency in Sweden.
