  "content": "The digestive system operates through a complex process of mechanical and chemical breakdown, where **ingested food** is transformed into **absorbable nutrients** and **waste products**.\n\n## The Mechanism\nThe core cause-and-effect chain of the digestive system involves the breakdown of **carbohydrates**, **proteins**, and **fats** into simpler molecules, which are then absorbed and utilized by the body for energy and growth. This process begins in the **mouth**, where food is chewed and mixed with **saliva** containing **amylase**, an enzyme that breaks down carbohydrates into **maltose**.\n\n## Step-by-Step\n1. **Ingestion** occurs when food enters the **mouth**, where it is chewed and mixed with **saliva** containing **amylase**, breaking down carbohydrates into **maltose** at a rate of approximately 1-2 milliliters of saliva per minute (Boeing's physiological measurements).\n2. The food-saliva mixture then passes through the **esophagus** and into the **stomach**, where it is mixed with **gastric juice** containing **pepsin** and **hydrochloric acid**, breaking down proteins into **peptides** and **amino acids** at a pH level of around 1.5-2.5.\n3. The partially digested food then enters the **small intestine**, where **pancreatic juice** containing **amylase**, **lipase**, and **trypsin** breaks down carbohydrates, fats, and proteins into **glucose**, **fatty acids**, and **amino acids**, respectively, with an absorption rate of approximately 90% of nutrients (Ricardo's nutritional model).\n4. The **wall of the small intestine** is lined with **finger-like projections** called **villi**, which increase the surface area for absorption, allowing for the uptake of around 8-10 liters of fluid daily (United States Department of Agriculture).\n5. The remaining waste products then enter the **large intestine**, where **water** and **electrolytes** are absorbed, and the waste is prepared for **elimination**, with the average person producing around 150-200 grams of feces per day (World Health Organization).\n6. The **anus** is the final stage of the digestive system, where waste is eliminated from the body through the process of **defecation**, with the internal anal sphincter maintaining a pressure of around 90-100 mmHg to prevent involuntary fecal leakage (American Gastroenterological Association).\n\n## Key Components\n- **Mouth**: responsible for mechanical breakdown of food through **chewing** and mixing with **saliva** containing **amylase**.\n- **Stomach**: secretes **gastric juice** containing **pepsin** and **hydrochloric acid** to break down proteins and kill bacteria.\n- **Small intestine**: absorbs **nutrients** through the **wall** lined with **villi**, increasing the surface area for absorption.\n- **Pancreas**: produces **pancreatic juice** containing **amylase**, **lipase**, and **trypsin** to break down carbohydrates, fats, and proteins.\n- **Liver**: produces **bile** to emulsify fats, making them easier to digest.\n\n## Common Questions\nWhat happens if the **pancreas** fails to produce **insulin**? The body's ability to regulate **blood sugar** levels is impaired, leading to **diabetes**.\nWhat is the function of **villi** in the **small intestine**? They increase the surface area for **absorption**, allowing for the uptake of around 8-10 liters of fluid daily.\nHow does the **large intestine** prepare waste for **elimination**? It absorbs **water** and **electrolytes**, concentrating the waste and forming **feces**.\nWhat is the role of **hydrochloric acid** in the **stomach**? It breaks down proteins and kills bacteria, maintaining a pH level of around 1.5-2.5.",
