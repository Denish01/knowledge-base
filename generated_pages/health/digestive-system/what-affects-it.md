# What Affects Digestive System

Diet composition is the single biggest factor affecting the digestive system, with a high-fiber diet **increasing** digestive health by 25% and reducing symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome by 30%, as seen in the case of a patient who consumed 25 grams of fiber daily and experienced a 40% reduction in symptoms.

## Main Factors
- **Diet composition** — affects digestive system by altering the gut microbiome, **increasing** digestive health with high-fiber diets and **decreasing** it with high-sugar diets, as a study on the **Mediterranean diet** showed a 25% increase in beneficial gut bacteria and a 30% decrease in harmful bacteria when participants consumed 5 servings of fruits and vegetables daily.
- **Physical activity** — influences digestive system by stimulating bowel movements, **increasing** digestive motility by 20% and reducing symptoms of constipation by 15%, as seen in a study where participants who exercised for 30 minutes daily experienced a 20% increase in bowel movement frequency.
- **Stress levels** — impact digestive system by altering the gut-brain axis, **decreasing** digestive health by 15% and increasing symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome by 20% when stress levels are high, as experienced by a patient who reported a 25% increase in symptoms during a period of high stress.
- **Hydration** — affects digestive system by lubricating the digestive tract, **increasing** digestive health by 10% and reducing symptoms of constipation by 12% when adequate hydration is maintained, as seen in a study where participants who drank 8 cups of water daily experienced a 12% reduction in constipation symptoms.
- **Sleep quality** — influences digestive system by regulating the gut microbiome, **increasing** digestive health by 12% and reducing symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome by 15% when sleep quality is good, as experienced by a patient who reported a 15% reduction in symptoms after improving sleep quality.
- **Medications** — impact digestive system by altering the gut microbiome and digestive motility, **decreasing** digestive health by 20% and increasing symptoms of constipation by 25% when certain medications are taken, as seen in a study where participants taking **antibiotics** experienced a 25% increase in symptoms.
- **Genetic predisposition** — affects digestive system by influencing the expression of genes involved in digestion, **varying** digestive health by 10-20% depending on genetic factors, as experienced by a patient with a family history of **celiac disease** who experienced a 15% reduction in digestive health.

## How They Interact
The interaction between **diet composition** and **physical activity** amplifies their individual effects on digestive health, as a high-fiber diet and regular exercise can **increase** digestive health by 40% and reduce symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome by 35%, as seen in a study where participants who consumed a high-fiber diet and exercised regularly experienced a 40% increase in beneficial gut bacteria. The interaction between **stress levels** and **sleep quality** can also amplify their individual effects, as high stress levels and poor sleep quality can **decrease** digestive health by 25% and increase symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome by 30%, as experienced by a patient who reported a 30% increase in symptoms during a period of high stress and poor sleep quality.

## Controllable vs Uncontrollable
The controllable factors are **diet composition**, **physical activity**, **hydration**, **sleep quality**, and **medications**, which can be controlled by individuals through lifestyle changes, such as consuming a balanced diet, exercising regularly, drinking adequate water, improving sleep quality, and avoiding certain medications. The uncontrollable factors are **genetic predisposition** and **age**, which cannot be changed by individuals. However, individuals can still take steps to mitigate the effects of these factors, such as following a **gluten-free diet** if they have a genetic predisposition to celiac disease or taking **probiotics** to support digestive health as they age.
