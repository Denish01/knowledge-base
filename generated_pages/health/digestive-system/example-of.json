  "content": "## Definition\nThe digestive system is a complex process by which the body breaks down and absorbs nutrients from food, involving the coordinated effort of multiple organs and enzymes, first described by **Galen** in the 2nd century AD.\n\n## How It Works\nThe digestive process begins in the mouth, where **salivary amylase** breaks down carbohydrates into simpler sugars, with the average person producing around 1.5 liters of saliva daily (National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research). As food enters the stomach, **gastric acid** and **pepsin** further break down proteins and fats, with the stomach lining producing approximately 2.5 liters of gastric juice every day (American Gastroenterological Association). The partially digested food then enters the small intestine, where most of the nutrient absorption takes place, with the walls of the small intestine covered in **microvilli** that increase the surface area for absorption by up to 600 times (Guyton and Hall, 2016).\n\nThe small intestine is also home to a diverse community of **gut microbiota**, with estimates suggesting that there are around 100 trillion microorganisms present in the gut at any given time (National Institutes of Health). These microorganisms play a crucial role in breaking down complex carbohydrates and producing certain vitamins, such as **vitamin K** and **biotin**. The large intestine, also known as the colon, is responsible for absorbing water and electrolytes, with the average person's colon absorbing around 1.5 liters of water per day (European Food Safety Authority).\n\nThe digestive system is also regulated by a complex system of **hormones**, including **gastrin**, **secretin**, and **cholecystokinin**, which help to coordinate the different stages of digestion. For example, **gastrin** stimulates the production of gastric acid in the stomach, while **cholecystokinin** stimulates the release of bile from the gallbladder. The digestive system is also influenced by the **enteric nervous system**, which is often referred to as the \"little brain\" of the gut, and is capable of functioning independently of the central nervous system (CNS) to regulate digestion.\n\n## Key Components\n- **Mouth**: breaks down food into smaller particles through **mastication**, with the average person chewing their food around 20-30 times per minute (Journal of Dental Research).\n- **Stomach**: secretes **gastric acid** and **pepsin** to break down proteins and fats, with the stomach lining producing around 2.5 liters of gastric juice every day (American Gastroenterological Association).\n- **Small intestine**: absorbs most of the nutrients from food, with the walls of the small intestine covered in **microvilli** that increase the surface area for absorption by up to 600 times (Guyton and Hall, 2016).\n- **Large intestine**: absorbs water and electrolytes, with the average person's colon absorbing around 1.5 liters of water per day (European Food Safety Authority).\n- **Gut microbiota**: breaks down complex carbohydrates and produces certain vitamins, such as **vitamin K** and **biotin**, with estimates suggesting that there are around 100 trillion microorganisms present in the gut at any given time (National Institutes of Health).\n- **Hormones**: regulate the different stages of digestion, including **gastrin**, **secretin**, and **cholecystokinin**, which help to coordinate the production of gastric acid, bile, and pancreatic juice.\n\n## Common Misconceptions\n**Myth:** The digestive system is only responsible for breaking down food \u2014 **Fact:** The digestive system also plays a role in the absorption of nutrients, with the small intestine absorbing most of the nutrients from food (Guyton and Hall, 2016).\n**Myth:** The stomach is the only organ responsible for digestion \u2014 **Fact:** The digestive process involves the coordinated effort of multiple organs, including the mouth, stomach, small intestine, and large intestine (American Gastroenterological Association).\n**Myth:** The gut microbiota is only present in the large intestine \u2014 **Fact:** The gut microbiota is present throughout the digestive system, including the mouth, stomach, small intestine, and large intestine (National Institutes of Health).\n**Myth:** The digestive system is not influenced by the nervous system \u2014 **Fact:** The digestive system is regulated by the **enteric nervous system**, which is capable of functioning independently of the central nervous system (CNS) to regulate digestion (Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology).\n\n## In Practice\nThe digestive system is essential for maintaining overall health, with **malnutrition** and **gastrointestinal disorders** affecting millions of people worldwide. For example, **Crohn's disease** and **ulcerative colitis** are two common gastrointestinal disorders that affect the digestive system, with around 1.4 million people in the United States alone suffering from these conditions (Crohn's and Colitis Foundation). The treatment of these conditions often involves a combination of **medications**, **dietary changes**, and **surgery**, with the goal of reducing inflammation and managing symptoms. In the United States, the annual cost of treating gastrointestinal disorders is estimated to be around $140 billion (National Institutes of Health).",
