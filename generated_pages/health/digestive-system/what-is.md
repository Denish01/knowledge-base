# What Is Digestive System?

## Definition
Digestive system is a complex process by which the body breaks down food into nutrients that can be absorbed and utilized for energy, growth, and repair, first described by **Galen** in the 2nd century AD.

## How It Works
The digestive system begins with the **mouth**, where food is chewed and mixed with **saliva** that contains **amylase**, an enzyme that breaks down carbohydrates into simpler sugars, with the average person producing approximately 1.5 liters of saliva daily (National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research). As food is swallowed, it passes through the **esophagus** and into the **stomach**, where it is mixed with **gastric juice** that contains **pepsin** and **hydrochloric acid**, which break down proteins and kill bacteria, with the stomach lining producing approximately 2.5 liters of gastric juice daily (American Gastroenterological Association). The partially digested food then enters the **small intestine**, where most of the nutrient absorption takes place, with the walls of the small intestine lined with **finger-like projections** called **villi** that increase the surface area for absorption, and the **pancreas** secreting **enzymes** such as **amylase**, **lipase**, and **trypsin** that break down carbohydrates, fats, and proteins into simpler molecules.

The digestive system also involves the **liver**, which produces **bile** that is stored in the **gallbladder** and released into the small intestine to help digest fats, with the liver producing approximately 1 liter of bile daily (American Liver Foundation). The **large intestine**, also known as the **colon**, absorbs water and electrolytes, and stores and eliminates waste, with the average person producing approximately 150 grams of feces daily (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases). The digestive system is controlled by a complex system of **hormones** and **nerves**, including the **vagus nerve** that stimulates the release of digestive enzymes and the **enteric nervous system** that regulates the movement of food through the digestive tract.

The digestive system is also influenced by the **gut microbiome**, which is composed of approximately 100 trillion microorganisms that live in the digestive tract and play a crucial role in the breakdown and absorption of nutrients, with the gut microbiome producing **short-chain fatty acids** that provide energy to the cells lining the colon, and **vitamin K** that is essential for blood clotting, with a study by the **Human Microbiome Project** finding that the gut microbiome is composed of over 1,000 different species of microorganisms (Human Microbiome Project).

## Key Components
- **Mouth**: breaks down food into smaller particles and mixes it with saliva that contains enzymes that break down carbohydrates, with the average person chewing food for approximately 30 minutes per day (National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research).
- **Stomach**: mixes food with gastric juice that contains enzymes that break down proteins and kill bacteria, with the stomach lining producing approximately 2.5 liters of gastric juice daily (American Gastroenterological Association).
- **Small intestine**: absorbs most of the nutrients from food, with the walls lined with finger-like projections called villi that increase the surface area for absorption, and the pancreas secreting enzymes that break down carbohydrates, fats, and proteins into simpler molecules.
- **Liver**: produces bile that is stored in the gallbladder and released into the small intestine to help digest fats, with the liver producing approximately 1 liter of bile daily (American Liver Foundation).
- **Large intestine**: absorbs water and electrolytes, and stores and eliminates waste, with the average person producing approximately 150 grams of feces daily (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases).
- **Gut microbiome**: breaks down and absorbs nutrients, and produces short-chain fatty acids and vitamin K, with the gut microbiome composed of over 1,000 different species of microorganisms (Human Microbiome Project).

## Common Misconceptions
**Myth:** The digestive system is only responsible for breaking down food into nutrients. **Fact:** The digestive system also plays a role in the immune system, with the gut microbiome producing antibodies that help to fight off infections (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases).
**Myth:** The stomach is the only part of the digestive system that produces digestive enzymes. **Fact:** The pancreas also produces digestive enzymes, including amylase, lipase, and trypsin, that break down carbohydrates, fats, and proteins into simpler molecules (American Gastroenterological Association).
**Myth:** The large intestine is only responsible for eliminating waste. **Fact:** The large intestine also absorbs water and electrolytes, and stores and ferments fiber, with the average person producing approximately 150 grams of feces daily (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases).
**Myth:** The gut microbiome is only composed of a few species of microorganisms. **Fact:** The gut microbiome is composed of over 1,000 different species of microorganisms, including **Bifidobacterium** and **Lactobacillus**, that play a crucial role in the breakdown and absorption of nutrients (Human Microbiome Project).

## In Practice
The digestive system is essential for the production of **biofuels**, with the **US Department of Energy** estimating that the production of biofuels from agricultural waste could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 100 million metric tons per year (US Department of Energy). The digestive system is also important for the production of **nutraceuticals**, with the **National Institutes of Health** estimating that the global market for nutraceuticals could reach approximately $250 billion by 2025 (National Institutes of Health). The digestive system is also critical for the treatment of **gastrointestinal diseases**, such as **Crohn's disease** and **ulcerative colitis**, with the **American Gastroenterological Association** estimating that approximately 1.4 million people in the US are affected by these diseases (American Gastroenterological Association).
