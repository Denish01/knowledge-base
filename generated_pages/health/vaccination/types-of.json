  "content": "There are several categories of vaccination, organized by the method of administration, the type of immune response elicited, and the target population, including **Inactivated Vaccines**, **Live Attenuated Vaccines**, **Subunit Vaccines**, **Conjugate Vaccines**, and **mRNA Vaccines**. \n## Main Categories\n- **Inactivated Vaccines** \u2014 vaccines containing killed pathogens that cannot replicate, characterized by their inability to cause disease, and exemplified by the **Flu Vaccine**, which contains inactivated influenza virus and is administered annually to prevent seasonal flu outbreaks.\n- **Live Attenuated Vaccines** \u2014 vaccines containing weakened pathogens that can replicate, characterized by their ability to elicit a strong immune response, and exemplified by the **Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) Vaccine**, which contains live, attenuated viruses and is administered to children to prevent measles, mumps, and rubella.\n- **Subunit Vaccines** \u2014 vaccines containing only specific components of a pathogen, characterized by their reduced risk of adverse reactions, and exemplified by the **Hepatitis B Vaccine**, which contains a surface antigen from the hepatitis B virus and is administered to prevent hepatitis B infection.\n- **Conjugate Vaccines** \u2014 vaccines containing a weakened pathogen linked to a carrier protein, characterized by their ability to enhance immune response, and exemplified by the **Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine**, which contains weakened pneumococcal bacteria linked to a carrier protein and is administered to prevent pneumococcal disease.\n- **mRNA Vaccines** \u2014 vaccines containing genetic material from a pathogen, characterized by their ability to elicit a specific immune response, and exemplified by the **Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine**, which contains mRNA from the SARS-CoV-2 virus and is administered to prevent COVID-19.\n\n## Comparison Table\n| Vaccine Type | Cost | Scale | Speed | Risk |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Inactivated Vaccines | Moderate (~$10-50 per dose) (CDC) | Large (millions of doses) | Slow (months to develop) | Low |\n| Live Attenuated Vaccines | Low (~$5-20 per dose) (WHO) | Medium (thousands to millions of doses) | Moderate (weeks to months to develop) | Moderate |\n| Subunit Vaccines | High (~$50-100 per dose) (GSK) | Small (thousands of doses) | Slow (months to years to develop) | Low |\n| Conjugate Vaccines | Moderate (~$20-50 per dose) (Pfizer) | Medium (thousands to millions of doses) | Moderate (weeks to months to develop) | Moderate |\n| mRNA Vaccines | High (~$100-200 per dose) (Moderna) | Small (thousands of doses) | Fast (weeks to develop) | Low |\n\n## How They Relate\nThe categories of vaccination often overlap, with some vaccines combining elements of multiple categories, such as **Conjugate Vaccines**, which use a combination of weakened pathogens and carrier proteins. **Inactivated Vaccines** and **Live Attenuated Vaccines** are commonly confused due to their similar methods of administration, but they differ in their ability to replicate and elicit an immune response. **Subunit Vaccines** and **mRNA Vaccines** are often compared due to their focus on specific components of a pathogen, but they differ in their use of genetic material versus protein components. **Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine** and **Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine** are examples of **mRNA Vaccines** that have been developed and administered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, demonstrating the ability of **mRNA Vaccines** to be developed quickly and elicit a specific immune response.",
