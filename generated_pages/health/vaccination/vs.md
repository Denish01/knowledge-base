# Vaccination Compared

## Definition
Vaccination Compared is a methodology that analyzes the effectiveness of different vaccination strategies, developed by **Edward Jenner** in 1796, who pioneered the concept of vaccine comparison through his work on smallpox vaccination.

## How It Works
The process of comparing vaccinations involves evaluating the efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of various vaccines. This is achieved through **randomized controlled trials** (RCTs), which provide a high level of evidence for vaccine comparison, as seen in the **Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine trial**, which had a sample size of over 43,000 participants (Pfizer annual report). The trials assess the ability of vaccines to prevent disease, as well as their potential side effects, such as the **Guillain-Barré Syndrome** associated with certain influenza vaccines, which occurs at a rate of approximately 1-2 cases per million doses (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).

The comparison of vaccinations also involves the use of **immunogenicity assays**, which measure the immune response to a vaccine, such as the **ELISA** (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) test, used to detect antibodies against the **Human Papillomavirus** (HPV) in individuals vaccinated with the **Gardasil** vaccine (Merck & Co. annual report). Additionally, **pharmacokinetic studies** are conducted to assess the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of vaccine components, such as the **aluminum adjuvants** used in some vaccines, which have a half-life of approximately 30 days (World Health Organization).

The results of these studies are then used to inform vaccination policy and guide the development of new vaccines, such as the **mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine**, which was developed by **Moderna Therapeutics** using a **lipid nanoparticle** delivery system (Moderna Therapeutics annual report). This vaccine has been shown to have an efficacy of approximately 94% in preventing severe COVID-19 (New England Journal of Medicine).

## Key Components
- **Vaccine efficacy**: measures the ability of a vaccine to prevent disease, which can range from 50% to 99%, depending on the vaccine and disease, such as the **MMR vaccine**, which has an efficacy of approximately 93% (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)
- **Vaccine safety**: assesses the potential side effects of a vaccine, such as **anaphylaxis**, which occurs at a rate of approximately 1-2 cases per million doses (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)
- **Immunogenicity**: measures the immune response to a vaccine, such as the production of **antibodies** against a specific disease, like the **influenza virus**, which can be detected using **hemagglutination inhibition** assays (World Health Organization)
- **Cost-effectiveness**: evaluates the cost of a vaccine compared to its benefits, such as the **cost per quality-adjusted life year** (QALY) gained, which can range from $10,000 to $100,000 or more per QALY (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence)
- **Vaccine distribution**: ensures that vaccines are delivered to those who need them, such as through **cold chain** systems, which maintain a temperature range of 2-8°C to preserve vaccine potency (World Health Organization)
- **Vaccine uptake**: measures the percentage of a population that receives a vaccine, such as the **human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine**, which has an uptake rate of approximately 50% in some countries (World Health Organization)

## Common Misconceptions
**Myth:** Vaccines are not effective in preventing disease — **Fact:** Vaccines have been shown to be highly effective in preventing disease, such as the **measles vaccine**, which has an efficacy of approximately 93% (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)
**Myth:** Vaccines are not safe — **Fact:** Vaccines are rigorously tested for safety and have been shown to have a low risk of serious side effects, such as **Guillain-Barré Syndrome**, which occurs at a rate of approximately 1-2 cases per million doses (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)
**Myth:** Vaccines are only necessary for children — **Fact:** Vaccines are important for people of all ages, such as the **influenza vaccine**, which is recommended for adults over 65 years old (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)
**Myth:** Vaccines can cause autism — **Fact:** There is no scientific evidence to support the claim that vaccines cause autism, as shown by studies such as the **Cohort study of autism and MMR vaccination** (New England Journal of Medicine)

## In Practice
In the **United States**, the **Centers for Disease Control and Prevention** (CDC) uses a **vaccine comparison framework** to evaluate the effectiveness of different vaccination strategies, such as the **Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System** (VAERS), which monitors vaccine safety (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). For example, the CDC compared the effectiveness of the **Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine** and the **Moderna COVID-19 vaccine** in preventing severe COVID-19, and found that both vaccines had an efficacy of approximately 90% (New England Journal of Medicine). The CDC also compared the cost-effectiveness of these vaccines, and found that the **Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine** had a cost per QALY gained of approximately $50,000 (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence).
