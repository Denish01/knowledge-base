# What Affects Cardiology

Hypertension is the single biggest factor affecting cardiology, increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease by 50% in individuals with systolic blood pressure above 140 mmHg, as seen in a study of 1 million patients by the American Heart Association.

## Main Factors
- **Hypertension** — increases the risk of cardiovascular disease by constricting blood vessels and overloading the heart, resulting in a 50% increase in risk for individuals with systolic blood pressure above 140 mmHg, as seen in patients with chronic kidney disease where hypertension is prevalent (American Heart Association).
- **Diabetes** — increases the risk of cardiovascular disease by damaging blood vessels and nerves, resulting in a 2-4 fold increase in risk for individuals with type 2 diabetes, as seen in the UK Prospective Diabetes Study where patients with diabetes had a 25% higher risk of cardiovascular disease (UK Prospective Diabetes Study Group).
- **Smoking** — increases the risk of cardiovascular disease by damaging the inner lining of blood vessels and reducing blood flow, resulting in a 200-300% increase in risk for heavy smokers, as seen in the Framingham Heart Study where smoking was a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (Framingham Heart Study).
- **Obesity** — increases the risk of cardiovascular disease by increasing blood pressure, triglycerides, and LDL cholesterol, resulting in a 20-30% increase in risk for individuals with a body mass index above 30, as seen in the Nurses' Health Study where obesity was a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease (Nurses' Health Study).
- **Physical Inactivity** — increases the risk of cardiovascular disease by reducing blood flow and increasing blood pressure, resulting in a 30-50% increase in risk for individuals who are sedentary, as seen in the Harvard Alumni Study where physical inactivity was a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease (Harvard Alumni Study).
- **High Cholesterol** — increases the risk of cardiovascular disease by building up plaque in blood vessels, resulting in a 20-30% increase in risk for individuals with total cholesterol above 240 mg/dL, as seen in the Lipid Research Clinics Coronary Primary Prevention Trial where reducing cholesterol levels reduced the risk of cardiovascular disease (Lipid Research Clinics Coronary Primary Prevention Trial).
- **Family History** — increases the risk of cardiovascular disease by inheriting genetic factors that increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, resulting in a 2-3 fold increase in risk for individuals with a family history of cardiovascular disease, as seen in the Framingham Heart Study where family history was a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease (Framingham Heart Study).

## How They Interact
The interaction between **Hypertension** and **Diabetes** amplifies the risk of cardiovascular disease, as seen in the UK Prospective Diabetes Study where patients with both hypertension and diabetes had a 5-fold increase in risk of cardiovascular disease (UK Prospective Diabetes Study Group). The interaction between **Smoking** and **High Cholesterol** also amplifies the risk of cardiovascular disease, as seen in the Framingham Heart Study where smokers with high cholesterol had a 5-fold increase in risk of cardiovascular disease (Framingham Heart Study). The interaction between **Physical Inactivity** and **Obesity** cancels out the benefits of physical activity, as seen in the Harvard Alumni Study where physically inactive individuals with obesity had a similar risk of cardiovascular disease as sedentary individuals (Harvard Alumni Study).

## Controllable vs Uncontrollable
The controllable factors are **Smoking**, **Physical Inactivity**, **Obesity**, and **High Cholesterol**, which can be controlled by individuals through lifestyle changes such as quitting smoking, increasing physical activity, reducing weight, and reducing dietary cholesterol. These factors are controlled by individuals and healthcare providers through education, counseling, and treatment. The uncontrollable factors are **Hypertension**, **Diabetes**, and **Family History**, which cannot be controlled by individuals but can be managed through medical treatment and lifestyle changes. Healthcare providers control the management of these factors through diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring.
