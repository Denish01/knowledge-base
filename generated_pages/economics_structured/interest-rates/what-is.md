# What is Interest Rates?

Interest rates refer to the percentage at which borrowed money is paid back to the lender, in addition to the original amount borrowed.

When individuals or organizations borrow money, they typically agree to pay back the loan with an additional amount, known as interest. This interest is a percentage of the original loan amount and is usually expressed as a decimal or a percentage. For example, if someone borrows $100 at an interest rate of 5%, they will need to pay back $105, which includes the original $100 plus $5 in interest. The interest rate is essentially the cost of borrowing money, and it can vary depending on a number of factors, such as the borrower's credit history, the type of loan, and the overall state of the economy.

In general, interest rates are set by lenders, such as banks, and are based on the level of risk associated with lending money to a particular borrower. Borrowers with good credit histories and a low risk of default are typically offered lower interest rates, while those with poor credit histories or a higher risk of default are offered higher interest rates. This is because lenders need to balance the risk of lending money with the potential return on their investment. When interest rates are high, borrowing money becomes more expensive, and when interest rates are low, borrowing money becomes less expensive.

The concept of interest rates is also closely tied to the concept of compound interest. Compound interest occurs when interest is earned on both the original loan amount and any accrued interest. This means that the interest earned in one period becomes the base for the next period, resulting in exponential growth over time. For example, if someone deposits $100 into a savings account that earns an annual interest rate of 5%, they will earn $5 in interest in the first year, making their total balance $105. In the second year, they will earn 5% interest on the new balance of $105, which is $5.25, making their total balance $110.25.

The key components of interest rates include:
* The principal amount, which is the original amount borrowed
* The interest rate, which is the percentage at which interest is charged
* The compounding frequency, which is the number of times interest is applied per year
* The loan term, which is the length of time the borrower has to repay the loan
* The amortization schedule, which is the schedule of payments the borrower must make to repay the loan
* The annual percentage rate (APR), which is the total cost of borrowing, including interest and fees

Some common misconceptions about interest rates include:
* That interest rates are always fixed, when in fact they can be variable and change over time
* That interest rates only apply to loans, when in fact they also apply to savings accounts and other investments
* That high interest rates are always bad, when in fact they can be beneficial for savers and investors
* That low interest rates are always good, when in fact they can lead to inflation and decreased purchasing power

A real-world example of interest rates in action is a mortgage. When someone buys a house, they often take out a mortgage to finance the purchase. The mortgage comes with an interest rate, which is the percentage at which the borrower must pay back the loan. For example, if someone takes out a $200,000 mortgage at an interest rate of 4%, they will need to pay back the loan, plus $8,000 in interest, over the life of the loan.

In summary, interest rates are the percentage at which borrowed money is paid back to the lender, and they play a critical role in the functioning of the economy, influencing everything from borrowing costs to investment returns.
