For example, if you enter 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, the calculator will calculate the mean, median, and mode of these numbers.\n\nA worked example is entering the numbers 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 into the calculator. The calculator will then output the mean, median, and mode of these numbers. \n\nThe output will help you understand the central tendency of your dataset.\n\n## The Formula Behind It\nThe formula for calculating the mean is: mean = (sum of all numbers) / (total count of numbers). \nThe median is the middle value when the numbers are arranged in ascending order. \nThe mode is the number that appears most frequently in the dataset.\n\nEach variable represents a different aspect of the dataset: the mean represents the average value, the median represents the middle value, and the mode represents the most common value.\n\n## Practical Examples\nHere are three real-world scenarios:\n- A company has 5 employees with salaries of $40,000, $50,000, $60,000, $70,000, and $80,000. The calculator outputs a mean of $60,000, a median of $60,000, and no mode since each salary is unique.\n- A student has exam scores of 70, 80, 90, 70, 80. The calculator outputs a mean of 80, a median of 80, and a mode of 70 and 80 since they both appear twice.\n- A store has daily sales of $100, $200, $300, $400, $500. The calculator outputs a mean of $300, a median of $300, and no mode since each sales figure is unique.\n\n## Common Questions\n### What is the difference between mean and median?\nThe mean is the average value, while the median is the middle value. For example, the mean of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 is 3, and the median is also 3.\n### Can the mode be more than one number?\nYes, the mode can be more than one number if multiple numbers appear with the same frequency. \n### What if my dataset has an even number of values?\nIf your dataset has an even number of values, the median will be the average of the two middle values. \n### How do I know which measure of central tendency to use?\nYou should use the mean if your dataset has no outliers, the median if your dataset has outliers, and the mode if you want to know the most common value. \n### Can I use this calculator for non-numeric data?\nNo, this calculator is only for numeric data. If you have non-numeric data, you will need to use a different calculator or method.",
