  "content": "## How United Kingdom Income Tax Works\nThe United Kingdom has a progressive income tax system, meaning that the more you earn, the higher tax rate you pay. The tax year in the UK runs from 6 April to 5 April the following year. For the 2023-2024 tax year, the income tax rates and brackets are as follows:\n- Basic rate: 20% on taxable income up to £50,000\n- Higher rate: 40% on taxable income between £50,001 and £150,000\n- Additional rate: 45% on taxable income above £150,000\n\n## How to Use This Calculator\nTo use this income tax calculator, you will need to input your taxable income, which includes income from employment, self-employment, and investments. You will also need to select your tax status, such as single, married, or divorced. \n- **Gross income**: Your total income before taxes and deductions.\n- **Taxable income**: Your income after deductions, such as pension contributions and charitable donations.\n- **Tax status**: Your marital status, which affects your tax allowances and rates.\n\nFor example, let's say you are a single person with a gross income of £40,000, and you contribute £5,000 to a pension scheme. Your taxable income would be £35,000, and your tax liability would be calculated based on the basic rate of 20%. \n\n## Key United Kingdom Income Tax Rules\nSome important rules to keep in mind when it comes to UK income tax include:\n* **Personal allowance**: Every individual is entitled to a personal allowance, which is tax-free.
