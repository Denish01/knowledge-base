  "content": "## How Kenya Capital Gains Tax Works\nKenya's capital gains tax system is designed to tax the profit made from the sale of properties, shares, and other investments. The tax is charged on the gain, which is the difference between the sale price and the original purchase price. As of the 2022 tax year, Kenya has a single capital gains tax rate of 5% for residents and 5% for non-residents on gains from the sale of properties and shares.\n\n## How to Use This Calculator\nTo use this calculator, you need to input the following:\n- **Purchase Price**: The original price you paid for the asset.\n- **Sale Price**: The price at which you sold the asset.\n- **Purchase Year**: The year you bought the asset.\n- **Sale Year**: The year you sold the asset.\nLet's take an example: John bought a house in Nairobi for KES 5 million in 2018 and sold it for KES 8 million in 2022. To calculate his capital gains tax, he would input these values into the calculator.\n\n## Key Kenya Capital Gains Tax Rules\nHere are some important rules to keep in mind:\n* The capital gains tax is only payable on the gain, not on the entire sale price.\n* The tax is payable within 30 days of the sale of the asset.\n* There are no exemptions for primary residences, but there are exemptions for certain types of investments, such as government bonds.\n* The tax rate is 5% for both residents and non-residents.\n* The Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) requires taxpayers to file their capital gains tax returns online through the iTax platform.\n\n## Common Questions\n### What is the deadline for filing capital gains tax returns in Kenya?\nThe deadline for filing capital gains tax returns in Kenya is within 30 days of the sale of the asset.
