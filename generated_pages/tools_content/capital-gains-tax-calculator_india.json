  "content": "## How India Capital Gains Tax Works\nThe Indian capital gains tax system is designed to tax the profits earned from the sale of capital assets, such as stocks, real estate, and mutual funds. The tax rates and brackets vary depending on the type of asset and the holding period. For the financial year 2023-24, the long-term capital gains tax rate is 20% for assets held for more than 24 months, while the short-term capital gains tax rate is 15% for assets held for 24 months or less.\n\n## How to Use This Calculator\nTo use this calculator, you need to input the following details:\n- **Selling price**: The price at which you sold the asset.\n- **Cost price**: The original price at which you purchased the asset.\n- **Holding period**: The duration for which you held the asset.\n- **Asset type**: The type of asset you are selling, such as stocks, real estate, or mutual funds.\n\nLet's consider an example: Suppose you purchased a stock for ₹100,000 and sold it for ₹150,000 after holding it for 36 months. Using this calculator, you would input the selling price (₹150,000), cost price (₹100,000), holding period (36 months), and asset type (stocks). The calculator would then calculate the long-term capital gains tax payable, which would be 20% of the gain (₹50,000), resulting in a tax liability of ₹10,000.\n\n## Key India Capital Gains Tax Rules\nSome important rules to keep in mind when calculating capital gains tax in India include:\n* The holding period for long-term capital gains is 24 months for immovable property and 12 months for listed securities.\n* The cost of acquisition and improvement can be indexed to account for inflation, reducing the taxable gain.\n* The tax exemption limit for long-term capital gains is ₹1 lakh per year for listed securities.\n* Filing deadlines for capital gains tax returns are typically July 31st for the previous financial year.\n* Special cases, such as the sale of inherited property, may be exempt from capital gains tax.\n\n## Common Questions\n### What is the tax rate for short-term capital gains?\nThe tax rate for short-term capital gains in India is 15% for assets held for 24 months or less.\n\n### Can I claim exemption on long-term capital gains?\nYes, you can claim exemption on long-term capital gains up to ₹1 lakh per year for listed securities.\n\n### How do I calculate the cost of acquisition for inherited property?\nThe cost of acquisition for inherited property is the fair market value of the property on the date of inheritance.\n\n### What is the deadline for filing capital gains tax returns in India?\nThe deadline for filing capital gains tax returns in India is typically July 31st for the previous financial year.\n\n### Can I use the calculator for calculating tax on foreign assets?\nNo, this calculator is designed specifically for calculating capital gains tax on Indian assets.
