The tax year in Brazil runs from January 1 to December 31. The current income tax rates in Brazil range from 0% to 27.5%, with three tax brackets: 0% on income up to R$1,903.98, 7.5% on income between R$1,903.99 and R$2,826.65, 15% on income between R$2,826.66 and R$3,751.05, 22.5% on income between R$3,751.06 and R$4,664.68, and 27.5% on income above R$4,664.68.\n\n## How to Use This Calculator\nTo use this calculator, you need to input your monthly or annual salary, select your filing status, and choose the tax year. For Brazil, the filing status options are single, married, or head of household. The calculator will then calculate your take-home pay, showing you how much you can expect to take home after taxes. For example, let's say you earn a monthly salary of R$10,000 and you are single.
