  "content": "## How South Africa Capital Gains Tax Works\nSouth Africa's capital gains tax (CGT) system is a tax on the profit made from the sale of assets, such as property, stocks, and bonds. The system is designed to tax the gain, or profit, made from the sale of these assets. The tax rates and brackets are as follows: \n- 0 - 50,000: 0% (exempt)\n- 50,001 - 1,000,000: 18% (effective rate)\n- 1,000,001 and above: 18% (effective rate), but with a higher inclusion rate of 40% of the gain.\n\n## How to Use This Calculator\nTo use this calculator, you need to input the following information:\n- **Original purchase price**: the price you paid for the asset\n- **Selling price**: the price you sold the asset for\n- **Costs incurred**: any costs associated with the sale, such as agent fees\n- **Inclusion rate**: the percentage of the gain that is taxable\nFor example, let's say you bought a property in Cape Town for R1,000,000 in 2018 and sold it for R1,500,000 in 2022. You also incurred R50,000 in agent fees. Using the calculator, you would input these numbers to get an estimate of your capital gains tax liability.\n\n## Key South Africa Capital Gains Tax Rules\nSome key rules to keep in mind when it comes to capital gains tax in South Africa include:\n* The **annual exemption** of R40,000 per person, which means that the first R40,000 of your capital gains are tax-free\n* **Primary residence** exemption, which means that you do not have to pay CGT on the sale of your primary home, as long as it is your primary residence\n* **Retirement fund** exemptions, which mean that you do not have to pay CGT on the sale of assets within a retirement fund\nThe filing deadline for capital gains tax is typically the same as the deadline for your income tax return, which is usually the end of February or June, depending on whether you are a provisional taxpayer.\n\n### Common Questions\n### What is the difference between a primary and secondary residence?\nThe difference between a primary and secondary residence is that a primary residence is the home where you live most of the time, while a secondary residence is a holiday home or rental property.
