  "content": "## How to Use This Calculator\nTo use the Dollar Cost Averaging Calculator, you need to input the total amount you want to invest, the number of months you want to invest over, and the expected monthly return on investment. The total amount is the sum of money you plan to invest in total, the number of months is how long you will be investing, and the expected monthly return is the percentage return you expect each month. For example, if you want to invest $12,000 over 12 months with an expected monthly return of 2%, you would input $12,000 as the total amount, 12 as the number of months, and 2% as the expected monthly return.\n\n## The Formula Behind It\nThe formula for dollar cost averaging is: Total Amount = Number of Months * (Monthly Investment + (Monthly Investment * (1 + Expected Monthly Return)^Number of Months - 1) / Expected Monthly Return). \n- Total Amount is the total sum of money invested.\n- Number of Months is how many months the investment is spread over.\n- Monthly Investment is the amount invested each month.\n- Expected Monthly Return is the percentage return expected each month.\n\n## Practical Examples\n- If you invest $10,000 over 10 months with an expected monthly return of 1.5%, the calculator will show you the total amount invested and the expected total value after 10 months. \n- If you invest $5,000 over 5 months with an expected monthly return of 3%, the calculator will show you the total amount invested and the expected total value after 5 months. \n- If you invest $20,000 over 20 months with an expected monthly return of 2.5%, the calculator will show you the total amount invested and the expected total value after 20 months.\n\n## Common Questions\n### What is dollar cost averaging?\nDollar cost averaging is a strategy where you invest a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the market's performance.
