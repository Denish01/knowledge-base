  "content": "## How to Use This Calculator\nTo use the Probability Calculator, enter the number of trials, the number of successes, and the probability of success for each trial. The number of trials is the total number of attempts, while the number of successes is the number of successful outcomes. For example, if you want to calculate the probability of getting 5 heads in 10 coin tosses, you would enter 10 as the number of trials, 5 as the number of successes, and 0.5 as the probability of success.\n\n## The Formula Behind It\nThe formula used in the calculator is: P(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * ((1-p)^(n-k)), where P(X = k) is the probability of k successes, n is the number of trials, k is the number of successes, nCk is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, p is the probability of success, and 1-p is the probability of failure. The variables are: n (number of trials), k (number of successes), p (probability of success), and nCk (number of combinations).\n\n## Practical Examples\n- A company sells 1000 products, and 200 of them are defective. If a customer buys 5 products, the calculator would output the probability of getting 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 defective products. \n- A student takes a 10-question multiple-choice test, and each question has a 0.8 probability of being answered correctly. The calculator would output the probability of getting 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 correct answers. \n- A gambler plays a slot machine 20 times, and each play has a 0.02 probability of winning. The calculator would output the probability of winning 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or more times.\n\n## Common Questions\n### What is the difference between probability and odds?\nProbability is a measure of the likelihood of an event, while odds are a way of expressing the probability as a ratio of favorable outcomes to unfavorable outcomes. \n### How do I interpret the results of the calculator?\nThe calculator outputs the probability of a specific number of successes, which can be used to make informed decisions or predictions. \n### Can I use the calculator for non-binary outcomes?\nNo, the calculator is designed for binary outcomes (success or failure), and it may not be accurate for non-binary outcomes. \n### What is the assumption of independence in the calculator?\nThe calculator assumes that each trial is independent, meaning that the outcome of one trial does not affect the outcome of another trial. \n### How accurate is the calculator?\nThe calculator is accurate for large numbers of trials, but it may not be accurate for small numbers of trials or extreme probabilities.",
