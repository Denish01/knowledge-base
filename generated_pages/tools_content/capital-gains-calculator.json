The purchase price is the amount you paid for the asset, the selling price is the amount you sold it for, and the tax rate is the percentage of tax you pay on your gains. For example, if you bought a house for $200,000 and sold it for $300,000, with a tax rate of 20%, you would input these numbers into the calculator.\n\nLet's say you bought 100 shares of stock for $50 each and sold them for $75 each, with a tax rate of 15%. You would input $5,000 as the purchase price, $7,500 as the selling price, and 15% as the tax rate.\n\n## The Formula Behind It\nThe formula for calculating capital gains tax is: Capital Gains Tax = (Selling Price - Purchase Price) * Tax Rate. \n- Selling Price is the amount the asset was sold for\n- Purchase Price is the amount the asset was bought for\n- Tax Rate is the percentage of tax paid on the gain\n\n## Practical Examples\nHere are three real-world scenarios:\n- You buy a condo for $400,000 and sell it for $550,000, with a tax rate of 20%. The calculator would output $30,000 as the capital gains tax.\n- You inherit a portfolio of stocks worth $100,000 and sell it for $120,000, with a tax rate of 12%. The calculator would output $2,400 as the capital gains tax.\n- You buy a rental property for $700,000 and sell it for $900,000, with a tax rate of 25%.
