  "content": "## How United States Income Tax Works\nThe United States has a progressive income tax system, meaning that higher income earners are taxed at a higher rate. The tax system is administered by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). For the 2022 tax year, there are seven tax brackets: 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35%, and 37%. The tax brackets and rates are adjusted annually for inflation.\n\n## How to Use This Calculator\nTo use this income tax calculator, you will need to input your filing status, number of dependents, and taxable income. **Filing status** refers to your marital status and determines which tax brackets and deductions you are eligible for. **Number of dependents** affects your eligibility for certain tax credits and deductions. **Taxable income** is your total income minus any deductions and exemptions.\n\nFor example, let's say you are a single person with two dependents, living in New York, and earning $80,000 per year. You would input:\n- Filing status: Single\n- Number of dependents: 2\n- Taxable income: $80,000\nThe calculator will then estimate your federal income tax liability.\n\n## Key United States Income Tax Rules\nSome important rules to keep in mind when filing your taxes in the United States include:\n* The **standard deduction** for the 2022 tax year is $12,950 for single filers and $25,900 for joint filers.\n* The **earned income tax credit (EITC)** is a refundable credit for low-to-moderate income working individuals and families.\n* The **child tax credit** is a non-refundable credit of up to $2,000 per child under the age of 17.\nThe IRS requires taxpayers to file their returns by **April 15th** of each year, unless an extension is granted.\n\n## Common Questions\n### What is the difference between a deduction and a credit?\nA **deduction** reduces your taxable income, while a **credit** reduces your tax liability directly.\n### How do I file for an extension on my tax return?\nYou can file for an extension using **Form 4868** by the original filing deadline of April 15th.\n### What is the penalty for not filing my tax return on time?\nThe **penalty** for not filing on time is 5% of the unpaid taxes for each month or part of a month, up to a maximum of 25%.\n### Can I e-file my tax return?\nYes, you can **e-file** your tax return using IRS-approved software or through a tax professional.\n### What is the IRS phone number for tax questions?\nThe **IRS phone number** is 1-800-829-1040, available Monday through Friday from 7am to 7pm local time.",
