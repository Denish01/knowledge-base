  "content": "## How India Vat Sales Tax Works\nIndia has a Goods and Services Tax (GST) system, which replaced the previous Value Added Tax (VAT) and other indirect taxes. The GST system has four tax brackets: 5%, 12%, 18%, and 28%. Additionally, there is a 0% tax bracket for essential goods and services.\n\nThe GST rates are applied based on the type of goods or services being sold. For example, essential items like food and healthcare are taxed at 0% or 5%, while luxury items like cars and tobacco products are taxed at 28%.\n\n## How to Use This Calculator\nTo use this calculator, simply enter the **cost of goods or services** and select the applicable **GST rate**. The calculator will then calculate the **total amount payable**, including the GST amount.\n\nFor example, let's say you are a seller of clothing in India, and you want to calculate the GST on a sale of ₹1,000. If the applicable GST rate is 12%, you would enter ₹1,000 as the **cost of goods or services** and select 12% as the **GST rate**. The calculator would then calculate the **total amount payable** as ₹1,120 (₹1,000 + ₹120 GST).\n\n## Key India Vat Sales Tax Rules\nHere are some important rules to keep in mind:\n* The GST registration threshold is ₹40 lakhs for suppliers of goods and ₹20 lakhs for suppliers of services.\n* Businesses with a turnover of more than ₹1.5 crores in the previous financial year must file their GST returns on a monthly basis.\n* The due date for filing GST returns is the 20th of the month following the end of the tax period.\n* Certain goods and services are exempt from GST, such as healthcare and education services.\n* Special rules apply to e-commerce operators, who must collect GST on behalf of their suppliers.\n\n## Common Questions\n### What is the GST registration process in India?\nThe GST registration process in India involves filing an online application with the GST portal, providing required documents such as a PAN card and business registration certificate, and verifying the application through an OTP sent to the registered mobile number.\n\n### Can I claim input tax credit on GST paid on business expenses?\n**Yes**, you can claim input tax credit on GST paid on business expenses, as long as the expenses are related to your business and you have a valid GST invoice.\n\n### How do I file my GST returns in India?\nYou can file your GST returns online through the GST portal, using a username and password.
