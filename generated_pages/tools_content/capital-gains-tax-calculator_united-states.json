The tax rate on capital gains varies based on the taxpayer's income tax bracket and the length of time the asset was held. For the 2022 tax year, the long-term capital gains tax rates are 0%, 15%, and 20%, depending on the taxpayer's filing status and income level. For example, single filers with income up to $41,675 are taxed at 0%, while those with income between $41,676 and $445,850 are taxed at 15%.\n\n## How to Use This Calculator\nTo use this calculator, simply input the following information:\n- **Purchase price**: The original price you paid for the asset.\n- **Selling price**: The price you sold the asset for.\n- **Holding period**: The length of time you held the asset.\n- **Filing status**: Your tax filing status (single, married filing jointly, etc.).\n- **Income**: Your taxable income for the year.\n\nFor example, let's say you're a single filer with a taxable income of $50,000. You purchased a stock for $10,000 and sold it for $15,000 after holding it for 2 years. Using this calculator, you would input these values to determine your capital gains tax liability.\n\n## Key United States Capital Gains Tax Rules\nSome important rules to keep in mind when it comes to United States capital gains tax include:\n* **Long-term vs. short-term gains**: Assets held for more than 1 year are considered long-term and are taxed at a lower rate than short-term gains.\n* **Primary residence exemption**: Up to $250,000 ($500,000 for married couples) of capital gains from the sale of a primary residence is exempt from tax.\n* **Wash sale rule**: If you sell a security at a loss and purchase a substantially identical security within 30 days, the loss is disallowed for tax purposes.\n* **Capital losses**: Capital losses can be used to offset capital gains, and up to $3,000 of excess losses can be deducted against ordinary income.\nFiling deadlines for capital gains tax are typically April 15th for individual taxpayers, with exemptions available for certain types of investments, such as tax-loss harvesting.\n\n### Common Questions\n#### What is the difference between long-term and short-term capital gains?\nLong-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than short-term gains, which are taxed as ordinary income.\n#### How do I report capital gains on my tax return?\nCapital gains are reported on Schedule D of the Form 1040 tax return.\n#### Can I use capital losses to offset ordinary income?\nYes, up to $3,000 of excess capital losses can be deducted against ordinary income.\n#### Are there any exemptions from capital gains tax?\nYes, certain types of investments, such as primary residences and tax-loss harvesting, are exempt from capital gains tax.\n#### How does the wash sale rule affect my capital gains tax liability?\nThe wash sale rule disallows losses from the sale of a security if a substantially identical security is purchased within 30 days.",
