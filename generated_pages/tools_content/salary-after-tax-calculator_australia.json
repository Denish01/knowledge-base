  "content": "## How Australia Salary After Tax Works\nThe Australian tax system is a progressive tax system, meaning that higher income earners are taxed at a higher rate. The tax year in Australia runs from July 1 to June 30. The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) is responsible for collecting taxes and administering the tax system. As of the 2022-2023 tax year, the tax brackets are:\n* 0 - $18,201: 0% tax rate (tax-free threshold)\n* $18,201 - $45,000: 19% tax rate\n* $45,001 - $120,000: 32.5% tax rate\n* $120,001 - $180,000: 37% tax rate\n* $180,001 and over: 45% tax rate\n\n## How to Use This Calculator\nTo use this calculator, you need to input your annual salary, select your tax residency status, and choose the tax year. The calculator will then estimate your salary after tax, taking into account the tax brackets and rates mentioned above. For example, if you earn $80,000 per year and are an Australian resident, the calculator will estimate your tax to be around $17,792, leaving you with a take-home pay of around $62,208.\n\n## Key Australia Salary After Tax Rules\nSome important rules to note when it comes to salary after tax in Australia include:\n* The tax-free threshold of $18,201 applies to all Australian residents.\n* Non-residents are taxed at a flat rate of 32.5% on their Australian-sourced income.\n* The Medicare levy of 2% applies to most taxpayers, although low-income earners may be exempt.\n* The deadline for lodging tax returns is October 31 each year, although taxpayers who use a tax agent may be eligible for an extension.\n\n### Key Filing Deadlines\nTaxpayers must lodge their tax returns by October 31 each year. \n* **Tax Agent Deadline**: If you use a tax agent, you may be eligible for an extension, typically until May 15 of the following year.\n* **Late Lodgment**: Failure to lodge on time may result in penalties and interest.\n\n## Common Questions\n### What is the tax-free threshold in Australia?\nThe tax-free threshold in Australia is $18,201.
