The federal tax is called the Goods and Services Tax (GST) and is set at a rate of **5%**. Additionally, each province and territory has its own provincial sales tax (PST) or harmonized sales tax (HST), which ranges from **0%** in Alberta to **15%** in Nova Scotia. The combined tax rate varies across provinces, with some provinces having a single HST rate and others having a separate GST and PST.\n\n## How to Use This Calculator\nTo use this calculator, simply enter the purchase amount, select the province, and choose whether the amount includes tax. The calculator will then calculate the total tax paid and the amount before tax. For example, let's say you're buying a car in Ontario for **$30,000**, which includes tax. You would enter **$30,000** as the purchase amount, select **Ontario**, and choose **Yes** for \"Includes tax\". The calculator will then calculate the tax paid and the amount before tax, using the Ontario HST rate of **13%**.\n\n## Key Canada Vat Sales Tax Rules\nHere are some key rules to keep in mind:\n* The GST applies to most goods and services, with some exceptions such as basic groceries and residential rent.\n* Provincial sales taxes apply to certain goods and services, such as liquor and tobacco.\n* Businesses with annual revenues over **$30,000** are required to register for a GST account and charge GST on their sales.\n* The GST and PST/HST filing deadlines vary depending on the business's annual revenues and the province.\n* Some goods and services are exempt from tax, such as medical devices and prescription drugs.\n\n### Filing Deadlines\nBusinesses with annual revenues over **$1.5 million** must file their GST returns monthly, while those with revenues between **$30,000** and **$1.5 million** can file quarterly or annually.\n\n### Exemptions\nCertain businesses, such as small suppliers with annual revenues under **$30,000**, are exempt from registering for a GST account and charging GST.\n\n### Special Cases\nSome provinces, such as Quebec, have their own separate sales tax system, which is not harmonized with the federal GST.\n\n## Common Questions\n### What is the GST rate in Canada?\nThe GST rate in Canada is **5%**.\n### Do I need to charge GST on my sales?\nIf your business has annual revenues over **$30,000**, you are required to register for a GST account and charge GST on your sales.\n### How do I file my GST return?\nYou can file your GST return online through the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) website, or by mail using the GST return form.\n### Can I claim a GST refund?\nIf you have paid more GST than you owe, you can claim a refund by filing a GST return and claiming the excess amount as a refund.\n### Are there any GST exemptions for charities?\nYes, registered charities are exempt from paying GST on certain goods and services, such as donations and fundraising events.",
