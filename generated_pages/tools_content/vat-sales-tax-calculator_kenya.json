  "content": "## How Kenya Vat Sales Tax Works\nThe Kenya VAT system is a consumption tax that is levied on the value added to goods and services at each stage of production and distribution. The current standard VAT rate in Kenya is **16%**, which applies to most goods and services. However, there are some exemptions and zero-rated supplies, such as basic food items, healthcare services, and educational services.\n\n## How to Use This Calculator\nTo use this VAT calculator, you need to input the cost of the goods or services, and then select the VAT rate that applies. For example, if you are a business owner in Nairobi selling electronics, you would input the cost of the electronics and select the **16%** VAT rate. The calculator will then calculate the total amount payable, including VAT.\n\nLet's use a worked example: suppose you are a retailer in Mombasa selling a TV for KES 50,000. You would input the cost of the TV (KES 50,000) and select the **16%** VAT rate. The calculator would then calculate the VAT amount (KES 8,000) and the total amount payable (KES 58,000).\n\n## Key Kenya Vat Sales Tax Rules\nHere are some important rules to note:\n* The VAT registration threshold in Kenya is **KES 5 million** per year.
