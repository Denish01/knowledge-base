  "content": "## How Kenya Income Tax Works\nThe Kenya income tax system is a progressive tax system, where the tax rate increases as the taxable income increases. The Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) is responsible for collecting income tax from individuals and companies. The current income tax rates in Kenya range from 10% to 30%. The tax year in Kenya runs from January 1 to December 31.\n\nThe tax brackets for the 2022 tax year are as follows:\n- 10% on taxable income up to KES 147,580\n- 15% on taxable income between KES 147,581 and KES 286,311\n- 20% on taxable income between KES 286,312 and KES 406,764\n- 25% on taxable income between KES 406,765 and KES 570,849\n- 30% on taxable income above KES 570,849\n\n## How to Use This Calculator\nThis calculator is designed to help you calculate your income tax liability in Kenya. To use the calculator, you will need to input your gross income, deductions, and exemptions. \n- **Gross Income**: This is your total income before any deductions or exemptions.\n- **Deductions**: These are expenses that can be deducted from your gross income, such as pension contributions or mortgage interest.\n- **Exemptions**: These are amounts that are exempt from income tax, such as disability allowances.\n\nFor example, let's say you have a gross income of KES 500,000 per year, and you contribute KES 50,000 to a pension scheme. You would enter these values into the calculator, and it would calculate your taxable income and income tax liability.\n\n## Key Kenya Income Tax Rules\nHere are some key rules to keep in mind when it comes to income tax in Kenya:\n* The tax year in Kenya runs from January 1 to December 31.\n* The deadline for filing individual tax returns is June 30 of the following year.\n* Employers are required to deduct income tax from their employees' salaries and remit it to the KRA on a monthly basis.\n* Self-employed individuals are required to file their tax returns on a quarterly basis.\n* Taxpayers can claim exemptions and deductions, such as pension contributions and mortgage interest, to reduce their taxable income.\n\n## Common Questions\n### What is the deadline for filing individual tax returns in Kenya?\nThe deadline for filing individual tax returns in Kenya is June 30 of the following year.\n\n### Do I need to file a tax return if I am employed?\nYes, you will still need to file a tax return, even if you are employed, if you have other sources of income or if you want to claim exemptions and deductions.\n\n### Can I claim exemptions and deductions on my tax return?\nYes, you can claim exemptions and deductions, such as pension contributions and mortgage interest, to reduce your taxable income.\n\n### How do I pay my income tax in Kenya?\nYou can pay your income tax through the KRA's online portal, or through a bank or other authorized payment agent.\n\n### What happens if I fail to file my tax return or pay my income tax on time?\nIf you fail to file your tax return or pay your income tax on time, you may be subject to penalties and interest on the amount owed.",
