The tax year in Canada runs from January 1 to December 31. For the 2023 tax year, the federal tax rates range from 15% to 33%. The tax brackets are as follows:\n- 15% on the first $53,359 of taxable income\n- 20.5% on taxable income between $53,359 and $106,717\n- 26% on taxable income between $106,718 and $147,667\n- 29% on taxable income between $147,668 and $210,371\n- 33% on taxable income over $210,371\n\n## How to Use This Calculator\nTo use this calculator, you will need to input your taxable income, province or territory of residence, and other relevant information. Each input field corresponds to a specific aspect of your tax situation, such as:\n- **Taxable income**: Your total income from all sources, minus any deductions or exemptions\n- **Province or territory**: Your place of residence, which affects your tax rate\n- **Number of dependents**: The number of people you support, such as children or elderly relatives\n\nFor example, let's say you are a resident of Ontario with a taxable income of $80,000 and two dependents. You would input these values into the calculator to get an estimate of your federal and provincial tax liability.\n\n## Key Canada Income Tax Rules\nHere are a few important rules to keep in mind when filing your taxes in Canada:\n* The tax filing deadline is typically April 30 of each year\n* You may be eligible for exemptions or credits, such as the Basic Personal Amount or the Canada Child Benefit\n* Self-employed individuals must report their business income and expenses on their tax return\n* You may be able to claim deductions for certain expenses, such as moving costs or home office expenses\n\n## Common Questions\n### What is the difference between federal and provincial tax?\nThe federal government and each province or territory have their own tax rates and brackets.
