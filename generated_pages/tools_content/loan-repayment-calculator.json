The loan amount is the total amount borrowed, the interest rate is the annual percentage rate, the loan term is the number of years to repay the loan, and the payment frequency is how often payments are made. For example, if you borrow $30,000 at 6% interest over 5 years with monthly payments, you can enter these values into the calculator to find your monthly payment amount.\n\n## The Formula Behind It\nThe formula used to calculate loan repayments is: M = P [ i(1 + i)^n ] / [ (1 + i)^n – 1], where M is the monthly payment, P is the loan amount, i is the monthly interest rate, and n is the number of payments. The monthly interest rate is calculated by dividing the annual interest rate by 12, and the number of payments is calculated by multiplying the loan term in years by 12.\n\n## Practical Examples\n- If you borrow $20,000 at 5% interest over 3 years with monthly payments, the calculator will output a monthly payment of approximately $594.\n- For a $50,000 loan at 7% interest over 10 years with biweekly payments, the calculator will output a payment every 2 weeks of approximately $583.\n- A $10,000 loan at 4% interest over 2 years with weekly payments will result in a weekly payment of approximately $93.\n\n## Common Questions\n### What is the difference between a fixed and variable interest rate?\nA fixed interest rate remains the same over the loan term, while a variable interest rate can change. \n- Fixed rate: 6% per year for the entire loan term\n- Variable rate: 6% per year, but can increase to 7% after 2 years\n### How often can I make loan payments?\nYou can make loan payments weekly, biweekly, or monthly, depending on your loan agreement. \n| Payment Frequency | Number of Payments per Year |\n| --- | --- |\n| Weekly | 52 |\n| Biweekly | 26 |\n| Monthly | 12 |\n### Can I pay off my loan early?\nYes, you can pay off your loan early, but you may be charged a penalty for early repayment. \n- Check your loan agreement for early repayment terms\n### How does the interest rate affect my loan repayments?\nA higher interest rate will increase your monthly payments and the total amount you repay over the loan term. \n- 5% interest: $500 per month for 5 years\n- 7% interest: $563 per month for 5 years\n### What happens if I miss a loan payment?\nIf you miss a loan payment, you may be charged a late payment fee and your credit score may be affected. \n- Contact your lender to discuss payment options if you are unable to make a payment",
