The tax is typically levied at a rate of 25% plus a 5.5% solidarity surcharge, which is a total effective rate of 26.375%. However, there are some exemptions and special rules that can reduce or eliminate the tax liability.\n\n## How to Use This Calculator\nTo use this calculator, you'll need to input the following information:\n- **Acquisition cost**: The original purchase price of the asset.\n- **Selling price**: The price at which you sold the asset.\n- **Holding period**: The length of time you owned the asset.\n- **Tax year**: The year in which you sold the asset.\n\nFor example, let's say you purchased a stock for €10,000 in 2018 and sold it for €15,000 in 2022. You would input these values into the calculator, along with the holding period of 4 years and the tax year 2022. The calculator would then estimate your capital gains tax liability based on the current tax rates and rules.\n\n## Key Germany Capital Gains Tax Rules\nSome important rules to keep in mind:\n* A **60-month exemption** applies to the sale of real estate, meaning that if you've owned the property for at least 60 months, the gain is tax-free.\n* **Losses can be offset** against gains from other assets, reducing your overall tax liability.\n* The **tax-free allowance** for capital gains is €801 per year for single filers and €1,602 per year for joint filers.\n* The **filing deadline** for capital gains tax is July 31st of the following year.\n* **Special rules** apply to the sale of business assets, such as equipment or inventory.\n\n### Common Questions\n#### What is the current capital gains tax rate in Germany?\nThe current capital gains tax rate in Germany is 25% plus a 5.5% solidarity surcharge, for a total effective rate of 26.375%.\n#### Are there any exemptions from capital gains tax in Germany?\nYes, there are several exemptions, including the 60-month exemption for real estate and the tax-free allowance of €801 per year for single filers.\n#### How do I report capital gains tax in Germany?\nYou'll need to file a tax return with the Finanzamt (tax office) by July 31st of the following year, using the **Erklärung zur Abgeltungsteuer** (Capital Gains Tax Return) form.\n#### Can I offset losses against gains from other assets?\nYes, losses can be offset against gains from other assets, reducing your overall tax liability.\n#### Are there any special rules for non-residents?\nYes, non-residents are subject to a **withholding tax** of 25% on capital gains from the sale of German assets, which can be credited against their final tax liability.",
