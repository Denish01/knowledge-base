For example, if you want to find 25% of $120, you would enter 120 as the initial value and 25 as the percentage. \n\nLet's say you want to calculate a 15% discount on a $200 purchase: you enter 200 as the initial value and 15 as the percentage, and the calculator will output the discount amount and the final price after the discount.\n\n## The Formula Behind It\nThe formula for calculating percentages is: result = (percentage / 100) * initial value. \nThe variables are: \n- result: the calculated percentage value\n- percentage: the percentage to apply\n- initial value: the base value.\n\n## Practical Examples\nHere are a few examples of using the percentage calculator:\n- If you earn $50,000 per year and get a 10% raise, the calculator will show that your new salary is $55,000.\n- A store is having a 20% off sale on a $100 item, and the calculator will output that the discount is $20 and the final price is $80.\n- If a company's stock price increases by 5% from $500 to a new price, the calculator will show that the new price is $525.\n\n## Common Questions\n### What is the difference between percentage and percent?\nPercentage and percent are often used interchangeably, but technically percent means \"out of 100\" and percentage is the result of a calculation.\n### How do I calculate reverse percentage?\nTo calculate the initial value based on a percentage result, enter the result and the percentage in the calculator.\n### Can I use the calculator for negative percentages?\nYes, you can use the calculator to calculate negative percentages, such as a 10% decrease.\n### How do I calculate a percentage of a percentage?\nTo calculate a percentage of a percentage, first calculate the first percentage, then use the result as the initial value to calculate the second percentage.\n### What if I need to calculate multiple percentages?\nYou can use the calculator to calculate each percentage separately, or calculate the total percentage by adding the individual percentages.",
