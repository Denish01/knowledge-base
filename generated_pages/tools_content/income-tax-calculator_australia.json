For the 2022-2023 tax year, the tax brackets are as follows:\n- 0 - $18,201: 0%\n- $18,201 - $45,000: 19%\n- $45,001 - $120,000: 32.5%\n- $120,001 - $180,000: 37%\n- $180,001 and over: 45%\n\n## How to Use This Calculator\nTo use this income tax calculator, you will need to input your taxable income, which includes your salary, wages, and any other income you have earned.
