The calculator will then provide an estimate of your total savings at retirement. For example, if you are 30 years old, want to retire at 65, have $10,000 in current savings, and save $500 per month, the calculator will estimate your total savings at retirement.\n\n## The Formula Behind It\nThe formula used in this calculator is: Total Savings = Current Savings + (Monthly Savings * Number of Months). \n- Current Savings is the amount you already have saved.\n- Monthly Savings is the amount you save each month.\n- Number of Months is the number of months between your current age and desired retirement age.\n\n## Practical Examples\nHere are three real-world scenarios:\n- If you are 25 years old, want to retire at 62, have $5,000 in current savings, and save $200 per month, the calculator would output approximately $245,000 in total savings at retirement.\n- If you are 40 years old, want to retire at 67, have $20,000 in current savings, and save $1,000 per month, the calculator would output approximately $430,000 in total savings at retirement.\n- If you are 35 years old, want to retire at 65, have $15,000 in current savings, and save $750 per month, the calculator would output approximately $380,000 in total savings at retirement.\n\n## Common Questions\n### What is a good retirement savings goal?\nA good retirement savings goal is to have at least 70% to 80% of your pre-retirement income. For example, if you earn $50,000 per year before retirement, you should aim to have at least $35,000 to $40,000 per year in retirement.\n### How much should I save each month for retirement?\nThe amount you should save each month for retirement depends on your income, expenses, and retirement goals. A general rule of thumb is to save at least 10% to 15% of your income each month.\n### Can I retire early if I save more?\nYes, saving more can help you retire earlier. For example, if you save $1,500 per month instead of $1,000 per month, you may be able to retire 2-3 years earlier.\n### What if I don't have any current savings?\nIf you don't have any current savings, you can still start saving for retirement. The calculator will estimate your total savings based on your monthly savings amount and number of months until retirement.\n### How often should I review my retirement savings plan?\nYou should review your retirement savings plan at least once a year to ensure you are on track to meet your retirement goals. You may need to adjust your monthly savings amount or retirement age based on changes in your income, expenses, or retirement goals.",
