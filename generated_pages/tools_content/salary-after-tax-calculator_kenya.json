  "content": "## How Kenya Salary After Tax Works\nThe Kenya tax system is based on a progressive tax structure, where higher income earners are taxed at a higher rate. The Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) is responsible for collecting taxes, including Pay As You Earn (PAYE) tax, which is deducted from an employee's salary. The current tax rates in Kenya range from 10% to 30%, with tax brackets adjusted annually for inflation.\n\n## How to Use This Calculator\nTo use this salary after tax calculator for Kenya, you need to input your gross salary, which is your total salary before taxes. The calculator will then deduct the applicable taxes based on the current tax brackets. For example, let's say you earn a gross salary of KES 80,000 per month. You would input this amount into the calculator, and it would calculate your net salary after deducting taxes, which might be around KES 56,000, depending on your tax bracket and other factors.\n\n## Key Kenya Salary After Tax Rules\nSome important rules to note about salary after tax in Kenya include:\n* The tax year in Kenya runs from January 1 to December 31.\n* Tax rates range from 10% for income up to KES 147,580 per annum, to 30% for income above KES 1,032,400 per annum.\n* Employees are required to file their tax returns by June 30 of each year.\n* Certain benefits, such as medical insurance and pension contributions, are tax-exempt up to a certain limit.\n\n## Common Questions\n### What is the tax threshold in Kenya?\nThe tax threshold in Kenya is KES 147,580 per annum, below which no tax is payable.\n### How do I file my tax return in Kenya?\nYou can file your tax return online through the KRA's iTax portal or manually at a KRA office.\n### Can I claim tax relief on my pension contributions?\nYes, you can claim tax relief on your pension contributions, up to a maximum of KES 20,000 per month.\n### What happens if I don't file my tax return on time?\nIf you don't file your tax return on time, you may be liable for penalties and interest on any tax owed.\n### How do I know which tax bracket I fall into?\nYou can use the tax brackets provided by the KRA or consult with a tax professional to determine which tax bracket you fall into, based on your gross income and other factors.",
