The cost of investment is the amount you spend on a project or asset, the gain from investment is the amount you earn from it, and the time period is how long you hold the investment. For example, if you invest $1,000 in a project that earns $1,500 over 2 years, you would input these values into the calculator to find your return on investment.\n\n## The Formula Behind It\nThe formula for calculating ROI is: (Gain from Investment - Cost of Investment) / Cost of Investment * 100 / Time Period. The variables are: \n- Gain from Investment: the total amount earned from the investment\n- Cost of Investment: the initial amount spent on the investment\n- Time Period: the duration of the investment in years.\n\n## Practical Examples\nHere are a few scenarios to illustrate how the calculator works:\n- If you invest $5,000 in a business that earns $8,000 over 5 years, the calculator would output an ROI of 6% per year.\n- A real estate investor buys a property for $200,000 and sells it for $250,000 after 3 years, the calculator would show an ROI of 8.33% per year.\n- A company spends $10,000 on a marketing campaign that generates $15,000 in revenue over 1 year, the calculator would output an ROI of 50% per year.\n\n## Common Questions\n### What is a good ROI percentage?\nA good ROI percentage depends on the type of investment, but generally, 10-15% per year is considered a decent return. \n### How does ROI differ from profit?\nROI takes into account the initial investment, while profit only considers the earnings. \n### Can ROI be negative?\nYes, if the gain from investment is less than the cost of investment, the ROI will be negative, indicating a loss. \n### How does time period affect ROI?\nA longer time period will generally result in a lower ROI, as the return is spread out over more years. \n### Is ROI the only factor to consider when evaluating investments?\nNo, other factors like risk, liquidity, and alignment with goals should also be considered when making investment decisions.",
