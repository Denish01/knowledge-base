This includes income from your business or freelance work, minus any business expenses. \nFor example, let's say you're a freelance writer with a net income of KES 800,000. You would enter this amount into the calculator to determine your self-employment tax liability. \nThe calculator will then apply the tax rates and brackets to your net earnings, taking into account any deductions or exemptions you may be eligible for.\n\n## Key Kenya Self Employment Tax Rules\nSome key rules to keep in mind when it comes to self-employment tax in Kenya include:\n* The tax year in Kenya runs from January 1 to December 31.\n* You are required to file your tax return by June 30 of the following year.\n* You may be eligible for deductions on business expenses, such as equipment, rent, and travel costs.\n* If your net earnings from self-employment are below KES 235,000, you are exempt from paying self-employment tax.\n\n### Filing Deadlines and Exemptions\nIt's essential to be aware of the filing deadlines and exemptions that apply to your specific situation.
