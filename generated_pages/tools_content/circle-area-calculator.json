  "content": "## How to Use This Calculator\nThe calculator requires one input: the radius of the circle. The radius is the distance from the center of the circle to its edge. For example, if you want to find the area of a circle with a radius of 5 units, you would enter 5 into the calculator.\n\nA worked example is finding the area of a circle with a radius of 4 units. You would enter 4 into the calculator, and it would output the area. \n\nThe input is straightforward, and the calculator does the rest of the work to find the area.\n\n## The Formula Behind It\nThe formula for the area of a circle is A = πr^2, where A is the area and r is the radius. \nThe variable π (pi) is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14159, and r is the radius of the circle. \n\n## Practical Examples\n- A circular garden with a radius of 10 meters has an area of approximately 314 square meters, as calculated by the circle area calculator.\n- A round pond with a diameter of 20 meters (radius of 10 meters) has an area of approximately 314 square meters.\n- A circular room with a radius of 7 meters has an area of approximately 154 square meters.\n\n## Common Questions\n### What is the unit of the area calculated by the circle area calculator?\nThe unit of the area is square units, where the unit is the same as the unit of the radius entered into the calculator. \n### Can I use the calculator for an ellipse?\nNo, the calculator is only for circles, and the formula used is specific to circles. \n### How accurate is the calculator?\nThe calculator uses a value of π as 3.14159, which is accurate to 5 decimal places. \n### Can I calculate the radius if I know the area?\nYes, you can rearrange the formula to solve for r: r = √(A/π). \n### Is the calculator limited to certain sizes of circles?\nNo, the calculator can handle any size of circle, from very small to very large radii.",
