Select your activity level from the options provided. For example, if you weigh 65 kilograms, are 170 centimeters tall, and 30 years old, and you have a moderately active lifestyle, you would enter these values into the calculator.\n\nLet's say you're a 30-year-old male, 175 centimeters tall, and weigh 70 kilograms, with a lightly active lifestyle. You would enter these values into the calculator to get your daily calorie needs. \n\nThe calculator will then provide you with your daily calorie requirements to maintain your current weight.\n\n## The Formula Behind It\nThe formula used to calculate daily calorie needs is: **calories = 66 + (6.2 * weight) + (12.7 * height) - (6.8 * age)**. \n- **weight** is your weight in kilograms\n- **height** is your height in centimeters\n- **age** is your age in years\n\nThis formula is then multiplied by an activity factor to determine your total daily calorie needs.\n\n## Practical Examples\nHere are a few examples of how the calculator works:\n- A 25-year-old female, 160 centimeters tall, and weighing 55 kilograms, with a very active lifestyle, would require approximately 2000 calories per day to maintain her weight.\n- A 40-year-old male, 180 centimeters tall, and weighing 80 kilograms, with a sedentary lifestyle, would require approximately 1900 calories per day.\n- A 35-year-old male, 170 centimeters tall, and weighing 65 kilograms, with a moderately active lifestyle, would require approximately 2200 calories per day.\n\n## Common Questions\n### What is a sedentary lifestyle?\nA sedentary lifestyle is one where you spend most of your time sitting or sleeping, with little or no exercise. Examples include office workers or people who spend most of their time watching TV or playing video games.\n### How accurate is the calorie calculator?\nThe calorie calculator is approximately 90% accurate, but this can vary depending on individual factors such as body composition and overall health.\n### Can I use the calorie calculator if I'm pregnant or breastfeeding?\nYes, but you should consult with a healthcare professional to determine your specific calorie needs, as these can vary greatly during pregnancy and breastfeeding.\n### How often should I recalculate my daily calorie needs?\nYou should recalculate your daily calorie needs whenever your weight, height, or activity level changes significantly, such as after a significant weight loss or gain, or if you start a new exercise routine.\n### Can I use the calorie calculator if I have a medical condition?\nYou should consult with a healthcare professional before using the calorie calculator if you have a medical condition, as certain conditions may require specialized calorie intake.",
