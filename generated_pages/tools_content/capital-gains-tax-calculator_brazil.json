The tax rate varies depending on the type of asset and the length of time it was held. As of the 2022 tax year, the tax rates range from 15% to 22.5%. For example, gains from the sale of stocks held for less than 180 days are taxed at 22.5%, while gains from stocks held for more than 720 days are taxed at 15%.\n\n## How to Use This Calculator\nTo use this calculator, you will need to input the following information:\n- The type of asset being sold (e.g. stock, real estate)\n- The purchase price of the asset\n- The sale price of the asset\n- The length of time the asset was held\nFor example, let's say you purchased 100 shares of a Brazilian stock for R$1,000 and sold them for R$1,500 after holding them for 2 years.
