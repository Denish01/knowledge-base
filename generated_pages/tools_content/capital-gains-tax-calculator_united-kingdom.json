  "content": "## How United Kingdom Capital Gains Tax Works\nThe United Kingdom's capital gains tax (CGT) system is designed to tax the profit made from the disposal of certain assets, such as property, shares, and investments. For the 2023-2024 tax year, the CGT rates are as follows: 10% for basic-rate taxpayers and 20% for higher-rate taxpayers. An additional 8% surcharge applies to gains from residential property, making the rates 18% and 28% respectively.\n\n## How to Use This Calculator\nThis calculator is designed to help you estimate your CGT liability in the United Kingdom. To use it, you'll need to input the following information:\n- The acquisition cost of the asset\n- The disposal proceeds (the amount you sold the asset for)\n- The amount of any losses you've incurred in the current tax year\n- Your income tax rate (basic or higher)\n\nFor example, let's say you bought a property in London for £200,000 in 2010 and sold it for £350,000 in 2023. You've also made a loss of £10,000 on another investment in the same tax year. Using this calculator, you would input the acquisition cost (£200,000), the disposal proceeds (£350,000), the loss (£10,000), and your income tax rate (e.g., higher rate). The calculator would then estimate your CGT liability.\n\n## Key United Kingdom Capital Gains Tax Rules\nSome important rules to keep in mind when it comes to CGT in the UK include:\n* The annual exempt amount: for the 2023-2024 tax year, the first £6,000 of gains is exempt from tax.\n* Private residence relief: if you've lived in a property as your main home, you may be eligible for relief from CGT.\n* Losses: you can use losses to reduce your CGT liability, but you must report them to HMRC.\n* Filing deadlines: you must report and pay any CGT due by January 31st following the end of the tax year in which the gain was made.\n* Special cases: certain types of assets, such as ISAs and pensions, are exempt from CGT.\n\n### Common Questions\n### What is the annual exempt amount for CGT?\nThe annual exempt amount for CGT is £6,000 for the 2023-2024 tax year. This means that the first £6,000 of gains is exempt from tax.\n### Do I need to pay CGT on my main home?\nGenerally, no. If you've lived in a property as your main home, you may be eligible for private residence relief, which exempts the property from CGT.\n### Can I use losses to reduce my CGT liability?\nYes. You can use losses to reduce your CGT liability, but you must report them to HMRC.\n### What is the deadline for reporting and paying CGT?\nYou must report and pay any CGT due by January 31st following the end of the tax year in which the gain was made.\n### Are there any special cases or exemptions from CGT?\nYes. Certain types of assets, such as ISAs and pensions, are exempt from CGT. Additionally, some types of disposals, such as gifts to charity, may also be exempt. **It's always a good idea to consult with a tax professional or financial advisor to ensure you're meeting your CGT obligations.**",
