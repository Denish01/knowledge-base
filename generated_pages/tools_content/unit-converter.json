  "content": "## How to Use This Calculator\nTo use this unit converter, enter the value you want to convert in the \"From\" field, select the unit type, and choose the unit you want to convert to in the \"To\" field. The calculator will then display the converted value. For example, if you want to convert 10 meters to feet, you would enter 10 in the \"From\" field, select \"Length\" as the unit type, and choose \"Feet\" as the \"To\" unit.\n\n## The Formula Behind It\nThe conversion formula is: **converted value = (input value * conversion factor)**. The conversion factor is a predefined value that varies depending on the unit type and conversion. For length conversions, the conversion factor might be 3.2808 (to convert meters to feet).\n\n## Practical Examples\n- Converting 5 kilometers to miles: the calculator would output approximately 3.107 miles.\n- Converting 1000 grams to pounds: the calculator would output approximately 2.20462 pounds.\n- Converting 100 degrees Celsius to Fahrenheit: the calculator would output approximately 212 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\n## Common Questions\n### What units are supported by this calculator?\nThe calculator supports various units, including length (meters, feet, miles), weight (grams, pounds, kilograms), and temperature (Celsius, Fahrenheit).\n### Can I convert between different unit types?\nYes, you can convert between different unit types, such as length to weight or temperature to length, but you need to select the correct unit type and conversion.\n### How accurate is the calculator?\nThe calculator uses predefined conversion factors to ensure accurate conversions, but rounding errors may occur for very large or small input values.\n### Can I use this calculator for currency conversions?\nNo, this calculator is for unit conversions only and does not support currency conversions.\n### Are the results rounded to a specific decimal place?\nYes, the results are rounded to 5 decimal places for most conversions, but this may vary depending on the unit type and conversion.",
