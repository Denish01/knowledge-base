Total assets include the value of your cash, investments, and properties, while total liabilities include your debts, such as loans and credit card balances. For example, if you have $10,000 in cash, $20,000 in investments, and a $50,000 mortgage, you would input $30,000 as your total assets and $50,000 as your total liabilities.\n\nLet's work through an example: John has $5,000 in his savings account, $15,000 in his retirement account, and owns a house worth $200,000. He also has a car loan of $10,000 and a credit card balance of $2,000. He would input $220,000 as his total assets ($5,000 + $15,000 + $200,000) and $12,000 as his total liabilities ($10,000 + $2,000).\n\n## The Formula Behind It\nThe formula for calculating net worth is: Net Worth = Total Assets - Total Liabilities. \n- Total Assets refers to the total value of everything you own, such as cash, investments, and properties.\n- Total Liabilities refers to the total amount of debt you owe, such as loans and credit card balances.\n\n## Practical Examples\nHere are three real-world scenarios:\n- Emily has $8,000 in her checking account, $12,000 in her investment portfolio, and a $150,000 house. She also has a $20,000 student loan and a $5,000 credit card balance. The calculator would output a net worth of $145,000 ($8,000 + $12,000 + $150,000 - $20,000 - $5,000).\n- David has $2,000 in cash, $8,000 in his 401(k), and a $100,000 condo. He also has a $30,000 car loan and a $1,000 credit card balance. The calculator would output a net worth of $79,000 ($2,000 + $8,000 + $100,000 - $30,000 - $1,000).\n- Rachel has $15,000 in her savings account, $25,000 in her brokerage account, and a $300,000 house. She also has a $40,000 mortgage and a $10,000 home equity loan. The calculator would output a net worth of $290,000 ($15,000 + $25,000 + $300,000 - $40,000 - $10,000).\n\n## Common Questions\n### What is net worth?\nNet worth is the difference between your total assets and total liabilities, and it represents your overall financial health. \n### Can I use this calculator for business net worth?\nYes, you can use this calculator to calculate the net worth of a business by inputting the business's total assets and total liabilities.\n### How often should I calculate my net worth?\nYou should calculate your net worth at least once a year to track your progress and make informed financial decisions.\n### What if I have multiple sources of income?\nYou can still use this calculator by inputting your total assets and total liabilities, regardless of how many sources of income you have.\n### Can I use this calculator to compare my net worth to others?\nYes, you can use this calculator to calculate your net worth and then compare it to the average net worth of people in your age group or income bracket.",
