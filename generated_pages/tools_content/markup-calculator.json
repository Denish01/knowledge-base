  "content": "## How to Use This Calculator\nThe calculator requires three inputs: the cost of the product, the desired profit margin, and the desired selling price. The cost of the product is the amount it costs to produce or purchase the item, the desired profit margin is the percentage of profit you want to make, and the desired selling price is the price at which you want to sell the item. For example, if the cost of a product is $100, the desired profit margin is 25%, and the desired selling price is $125, the calculator will determine the markup amount.\n\n## The Formula Behind It\nThe formula used to calculate the markup is: Markup = (Selling Price - Cost) / Cost * 100. The variables in this equation are the Selling Price, which is the price at which the item is sold, the Cost, which is the amount it costs to produce or purchase the item. The result is the markup amount, which is expressed as a percentage.\n\n## Practical Examples\n- If a company purchases a product for $50 and wants to make a 30% profit, the calculator will determine the selling price to be $65. \n- A retailer buys a shirt for $20 and wants to sell it for a 50% markup, the calculator will determine the selling price to be $30.\n- A manufacturer produces a product for $100 and wants to make a 20% profit, the calculator will determine the selling price to be $120.\n\n## Common Questions\n### What is the difference between markup and margin?\nMarkup is the amount added to the cost of a product to determine the selling price, while margin is the difference between the selling price and the cost, expressed as a percentage of the selling price. \n### How do I calculate the selling price using the markup percentage?\nTo calculate the selling price, you can use the formula: Selling Price = Cost + (Cost * Markup Percentage).\n### Can I use the calculator to determine the cost of a product if I know the selling price and markup percentage?\nYes, you can use the calculator to determine the cost of a product by entering the selling price and markup percentage.\n### What is a typical markup percentage for retail products?\nA typical markup percentage for retail products can range from 20% to 50%, depending on the type of product, industry, and target market.\n### How does the calculator handle decimal values for the markup percentage?\nThe calculator will accept decimal values for the markup percentage, allowing you to enter precise values, such as 25.5% or 12.25%.",
