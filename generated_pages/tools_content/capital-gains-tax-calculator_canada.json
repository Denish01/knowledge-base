The system is based on a progressive tax rate, with the tax rate increasing as the individual's taxable income increases. For the 2023 tax year, the federal tax rates range from 15% to 33%. In addition to federal tax, provinces and territories also impose their own tax rates, which can range from 4% to 16%.\n\n## How to Use This Calculator\nTo use this calculator, you will need to input the following information: \n- **Proceeds of disposition**: the sale price of the asset\n- **Adjusted cost base**: the original purchase price of the asset, plus any additional costs\n- **Capital gains exemption**: if the asset is eligible for a capital gains exemption, such as a primary residence\n- **Tax year**: the year in which the asset was sold\n\nFor example, let's say you sold a rental property in Toronto for $800,000 in 2023.
