The borrower agrees to repay the loan, plus interest, over a set period of time. Auto loans can be used to buy new or used cars, trucks, vans, and other types of vehicles. They are a common way for people to acquire a vehicle when they do not have the full amount of money to pay for it upfront.\n\n2. EVERYDAY EXAMPLES\nMany people use auto loans to buy their daily drivers. For example, Sarah purchases a used Honda Civic for $15,000. She pays $2,000 as a down payment and finances the remaining $13,000 through a 5-year auto loan with a 6% interest rate. Her monthly payment is $248. John, on the other hand, buys a new Ford F-150 for $35,000. He puts down $5,000 and takes out a 6-year auto loan for $30,000 at 5% interest. His monthly payment is $479. Emily buys a Toyota Corolla for $18,000, paying $3,000 down and financing $15,000 over 4 years at 7% interest, resulting in a $348 monthly payment. In each of these cases, the individual is able to drive away in their new vehicle and repay the loan over time.\n\nMichael, a college student, buys a used Nissan Sentra for $10,000. He pays $1,000 down and takes out a 3-year auto loan for $9,000 at 8% interest. His monthly payment is $283. These everyday examples illustrate how auto loans are used by people from various walks of life to purchase vehicles for personal use.\n\n3. NOTABLE EXAMPLES\nSome notable examples of auto loans include those taken out by businesses or for luxury vehicles. For instance, a company like FedEx might take out a large auto loan to purchase a fleet of delivery trucks. Let's say FedEx buys 100 trucks for $50,000 each, totaling $5 million. They pay $1 million down and finance the remaining $4 million over 7 years at 4% interest. Their monthly payment would be approximately $55,000. On the luxury side, someone buying a high-end vehicle like a Mercedes-Benz S-Class for $100,000 might put down $20,000 and finance $80,000 over 5 years at 6% interest, making their monthly payment about $1,581.\n\nAnother notable example could be a farmer purchasing a heavy-duty pickup truck for agricultural use. The farmer buys a Chevrolet Silverado for $40,000, paying $8,000 down and financing $32,000 over 6 years at 5% interest. The monthly payment would be around $533. These examples show how auto loans can be used for a wide range of vehicles and purposes.\n\n4. EDGE CASES\nThere are also some less common scenarios where auto loans are used. For example, someone might take out an auto loan to purchase a recreational vehicle, such as a motorhome. Let's say a family buys a motorhome for $60,000, paying $10,000 down and financing $50,000 over 10 years at 7% interest. Their monthly payment would be approximately $633. Another edge case could be an auto loan for a vehicle that is not for personal or business use but for a specific hobby, such as a collector car.\n\n5. NON-EXAMPLES\nSome things that people might confuse for auto loans but are not include personal loans used for other purposes. For example, if someone takes out a personal loan to pay for a wedding, this is not an auto loan, even if they use some of the money to rent a limousine. Another non-example would be a mortgage, which is a loan secured by real estate, not a vehicle. Lastly, a credit card used to buy gas or make purchases at an auto parts store is not an auto loan, as it is not a dedicated loan for purchasing a vehicle.\n\n6. PATTERN\nAll valid examples of auto loans have in common that they are loans specifically used to purchase a vehicle, with the vehicle serving as collateral for the loan. The loans have a defined repayment period, an interest rate, and monthly payments that include both principal and interest. Whether the loan is for a personal vehicle, a business fleet, or a luxury car, these elements remain constant. This pattern highlights the core characteristics of an auto loan, distinguishing it from other types of financing.",
