  "content": "There are four primary categories of alimony, organized by their purpose and duration, namely **Temporary Alimony**, **Rehabilitative Alimony**, **Permanent Alimony**, and **Reimbursement Alimony**.\n\n## Main Categories\n- **Temporary Alimony** \u2014 awarded to support a spouse during the divorce process, typically ending when the divorce is finalized, as seen in the case of **Katie Holmes**, who received temporary alimony from Tom Cruise during their divorce proceedings.\n- **Rehabilitative Alimony** \u2014 intended to help a spouse become self-sufficient, often through education or job training, with **Tiger Woods' ex-wife Elin Nordegren** receiving rehabilitative alimony to pursue her education.\n- **Permanent Alimony** \u2014 ongoing support paid to a spouse, usually until the recipient remarries or dies, as in the case of **Mel Gibson's ex-wife Robyn Moore**, who received permanent alimony as part of their divorce settlement.\n- **Reimbursement Alimony** \u2014 awarded to compensate a spouse for expenses incurred during the marriage, such as education or business investments, with **Bristol Palin's ex-fianc\u00e9 Levi Johnston** ordered to pay reimbursement alimony for childcare expenses.\n\n## Comparison Table\n| Type of Alimony | Purpose | Duration | Example |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Temporary | Support during divorce | Until divorce is finalized | Katie Holmes |\n| Rehabilitative | Help spouse become self-sufficient | Until spouse is self-sufficient | Tiger Woods' ex-wife Elin Nordegren |\n| Permanent | Ongoing support | Until recipient remarries or dies | Mel Gibson's ex-wife Robyn Moore |\n| Reimbursement | Compensate for expenses | Until expenses are reimbursed | Bristol Palin's ex-fianc\u00e9 Levi Johnston |\n\n## How They Relate\nThe categories of alimony can overlap, with **Temporary Alimony** often leading to **Rehabilitative Alimony** or **Permanent Alimony** if the supported spouse requires ongoing support. **Rehabilitative Alimony** and **Reimbursement Alimony** can be confused due to their focus on supporting a spouse's financial well-being, but **Rehabilitative Alimony** is focused on future self-sufficiency, while **Reimbursement Alimony** is focused on past expenses. Specifically, **Temporary Alimony** and **Permanent Alimony** are often distinguished by their duration, with **Temporary Alimony** being shorter-term and **Permanent Alimony** being longer-term. In contrast, **Rehabilitative Alimony** and **Reimbursement Alimony** are distinguished by their purpose, with **Rehabilitative Alimony** focused on education or job training and **Reimbursement Alimony** focused on compensating for expenses.",
