# What Is Alimony?

## Definition
Alimony is a court-ordered payment from one spouse to another after a divorce or separation, originating from English common law, with the term "alimony" derived from the Latin word "alere," meaning to nourish or support.

## How It Works
Alimony payments are typically determined by a court based on factors such as the length of the marriage, the income and earning potential of each spouse, and the standard of living established during the marriage. The court may consider the **Gross Income** of each spouse, with the US Bureau of Labor Statistics reporting that the average annual salary for men is ~$53,000 (US Bureau of Labor Statistics) and for women is ~$43,000 (US Bureau of Labor Statistics). The **Tax Cuts and Jobs Act** of 2017 also affects alimony payments, as it eliminates the deduction for alimony payments for divorces finalized after December 31, 2018.

The amount and duration of alimony payments can vary significantly depending on the jurisdiction and the specific circumstances of the case. For example, in some states, alimony may be awarded for a specific period, such as **Rehabilitative Alimony**, which is intended to help the recipient spouse become self-sufficient. In other cases, alimony may be awarded on a more permanent basis, such as **Permanent Alimony**, which is intended to provide ongoing support to the recipient spouse. The **American Community Survey** reports that in 2019, approximately 243,000 men and 459,000 women received alimony payments (American Community Survey).

The payment structure of alimony can also impact the recipient spouse's ability to become self-sufficient. For instance, **Lump Sum Alimony** payments can provide a one-time infusion of cash, while **Periodic Alimony** payments can provide ongoing support. The **Uniform Marriage and Divorce Act** recommends that courts consider the **marital standard of living** when determining alimony payments, taking into account factors such as the couple's income, expenses, and debt.

## Key Components
- **Income**: The income of each spouse is a critical factor in determining alimony payments, with higher-income spouses typically being required to pay more in alimony.
- **Length of Marriage**: The length of the marriage can impact the amount and duration of alimony payments, with longer marriages often resulting in more substantial alimony awards.
- **Earning Potential**: The earning potential of each spouse is also considered, with spouses having higher earning potential often being required to pay more in alimony.
- **Standard of Living**: The standard of living established during the marriage is a key factor in determining alimony payments, with the goal of maintaining a similar standard of living for both spouses after the divorce.
- **Tax Implications**: The tax implications of alimony payments can significantly impact the recipient spouse's net income, with alimony payments being taxable to the recipient spouse and deductible by the payor spouse prior to the **Tax Cuts and Jobs Act**.
- **Modifications**: Alimony payments can be modified or terminated based on changes in circumstances, such as a change in income or remarriage.

## Common Misconceptions
**Myth:** Alimony is always awarded to the wife — **Fact:** Alimony can be awarded to either spouse, depending on the circumstances of the case, with approximately 3% of alimony recipients being men (American Community Survey).
**Myth:** Alimony is always permanent — **Fact:** Alimony can be awarded for a specific period or on a more permanent basis, depending on the jurisdiction and the specific circumstances of the case.
**Myth:** Alimony payments are not taxable — **Fact:** Alimony payments are taxable to the recipient spouse and were deductible by the payor spouse prior to the **Tax Cuts and Jobs Act**.
**Myth:** Alimony payments cannot be modified — **Fact:** Alimony payments can be modified or terminated based on changes in circumstances, such as a change in income or remarriage.

## In Practice
In the United States, alimony payments can have significant financial implications for both spouses. For example, in the case of a couple with a high **marital standard of living**, the court may award **Permanent Alimony** to the recipient spouse to maintain a similar standard of living. In a specific scenario, a couple in California with a **Gross Income** of $200,000 and a **marital standard of living** of $150,000 may have the court award the recipient spouse $50,000 per year in alimony payments, taking into account the **Tax Cuts and Jobs Act** and the **Uniform Marriage and Divorce Act**.
