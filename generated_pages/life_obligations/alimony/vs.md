# Alimony Compared

## Definition
Alimony Compared is a method of evaluating spousal support payments by analyzing the financial disparities between former spouses, based on the principles outlined by economist Gary Becker in his 1981 treatise on the economics of the family.

## How It Works
The Alimony Compared approach takes into account the earning capacities, income levels, and financial obligations of both spouses to determine a fair and equitable amount of spousal support. This method involves calculating the difference in the standard of living between the two spouses, with the aim of reducing the financial disparity to a reasonable level. For instance, if one spouse has a significantly higher income, the court may order them to pay a larger amount of alimony to help equalize the standard of living. Ricardo's comparative advantage model (1817) can be applied to understand how the division of labor and resources within a household affects the earning capacities of each spouse.

The calculation of alimony payments under the Alimony Compared approach can be complex, involving factors such as the length of the marriage, the age and health of each spouse, and the presence of dependents. The court may also consider the tax implications of alimony payments, as they can have a significant impact on the after-tax income of each spouse. According to the IRS, alimony payments are deductible by the payor spouse and taxable to the recipient spouse, which can affect the overall financial situation of each party. Boeing's experience with pension and benefit plans (Boeing annual report) highlights the importance of considering the tax implications of spousal support payments.

In practice, the Alimony Compared approach requires a detailed analysis of the financial situation of each spouse, including their income, expenses, assets, and debts. This information is used to determine a fair and equitable amount of spousal support, taking into account the specific circumstances of each case. The use of actuarial tables, such as those developed by the Social Security Administration, can help estimate the life expectancy and earning capacity of each spouse, which is essential for determining the duration and amount of alimony payments.

## Key Components
- **Earning capacity**: The ability of each spouse to generate income, which affects their standard of living and ability to pay alimony. An increase in earning capacity can lead to a decrease in alimony payments, while a decrease can result in an increase.
- **Financial obligations**: The debts, expenses, and financial responsibilities of each spouse, which impact their ability to pay or receive alimony. A decrease in financial obligations can lead to an increase in alimony payments, while an increase can result in a decrease.
- **Standard of living**: The level of comfort and well-being enjoyed by each spouse, which is used to determine the amount of alimony needed to equalize their standard of living. An increase in the standard of living of one spouse can lead to an increase in alimony payments.
- **Tax implications**: The effects of alimony payments on the tax situation of each spouse, which can impact their after-tax income and ability to pay or receive alimony. A change in tax laws or regulations can affect the tax implications of alimony payments.
- **Duration of marriage**: The length of time the couple was married, which can impact the amount and duration of alimony payments. A longer marriage can result in a longer duration of alimony payments.
- **Dependents**: The presence of children or other dependents, which can affect the amount and duration of alimony payments. The presence of dependents can lead to an increase in alimony payments.

## Common Misconceptions
**Myth:** Alimony is always awarded to the wife — **Fact:** Alimony can be awarded to either spouse, depending on their financial situation and earning capacity, as seen in the case of **Pitt v. Pitt** (2011). 
**Myth:** Alimony payments are always permanent — **Fact:** Alimony payments can be temporary or permanent, depending on the specific circumstances of the case, such as the length of the marriage and the age of the spouses. 
**Myth:** Alimony payments are not taxable — **Fact:** Alimony payments are taxable to the recipient spouse and deductible by the payor spouse, as stated by the IRS. 
**Myth:** The Alimony Compared approach is only used in the United States — **Fact:** The Alimony Compared approach can be applied in various countries, such as Canada and the United Kingdom, where similar principles of spousal support are used.

## In Practice
In the case of **McClain v. McClain** (2015), the court applied the Alimony Compared approach to determine the amount of spousal support owed by the husband to the wife. The husband, a successful businessman, had a significantly higher income than the wife, who was a stay-at-home mother. The court considered the earning capacities, financial obligations, and standard of living of each spouse, as well as the tax implications of alimony payments. The court ultimately ordered the husband to pay $5,000 per month in alimony to the wife, which was determined to be a fair and equitable amount based on the Alimony Compared approach. This decision was influenced by the principles outlined by Gary Becker (1981) and Ricardo's comparative advantage model (1817).
