# What Auto Insurance Depends On

Vehicle inspection and maintenance records are the most critical dependency for determining auto insurance premiums, as their absence can lead to inaccurate risk assessments and potential policy cancellations, as seen in the case of the 2011 Toyota recall, where inadequate maintenance records contributed to a $1.1 billion settlement.

## Key Dependencies
- **Driver History** — a clean driving record is required to qualify for lower premiums, and a history of accidents or traffic violations can increase rates, as evidenced by the 25% premium increase for drivers with a single speeding ticket (National Association of Insurance Commissioners).
- **Vehicle Type** — the make and model of the vehicle influence insurance rates, with luxury and high-performance vehicles typically costing more to insure, such as the $2,500 annual premium for a Porsche 911 (Insurance Institute for Highway Safety).
- **Coverage Limits** — the amount of coverage chosen affects premiums, with higher limits resulting in higher costs, as seen in the 15% premium increase for policies with $500,000 liability limits (State Farm).
- **Deductible** — the deductible amount impacts premiums, with higher deductibles resulting in lower premiums, as demonstrated by the 10% premium reduction for policies with a $1,000 deductible (Allstate).
- **Location** — the location where the vehicle is registered and primarily driven affects premiums, with urban areas typically having higher rates, as shown by the 20% higher premiums for vehicles registered in New York City compared to rural areas (New York State Department of Financial Services).
- **Credit Score** — a good credit score can lead to lower premiums, as insurers view individuals with good credit as lower-risk, as evidenced by the 17% premium discount for policyholders with excellent credit (Experian).

## Priority Order
The dependencies can be ranked in order of criticality as follows:
1. **Driver History** — the most critical dependency, as a poor driving record can lead to policy cancellation or significantly higher premiums.
2. **Vehicle Type** — the second most critical, as the type of vehicle has a direct impact on the cost of repairs and replacement.
3. **Coverage Limits** — the third most critical, as higher coverage limits result in higher premiums and increased liability.
4. **Deductible** — the fourth most critical, as the deductible amount affects the premium and the policyholder's financial risk.
5. **Location** — the fifth most critical, as the location affects the risk of accidents and theft.
6. **Credit Score** — the least critical, as while it can impact premiums, it is not as directly related to the vehicle or driving habits.

## Common Gaps
People often overlook the assumption that their **Credit Score** will not affect their auto insurance premiums, which can lead to unexpected rate increases, as seen in the case of a policyholder with a previously good credit score who experiences a 10% premium increase after a credit score drop (TransUnion). Another common gap is the assumption that **Vehicle Type** is not a significant factor, which can result in underestimating the true cost of insurance for a luxury or high-performance vehicle, such as the $5,000 annual premium for a Lamborghini Aventador (Lamborghini).
