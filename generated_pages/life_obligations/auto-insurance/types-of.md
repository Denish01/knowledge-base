# Types of Auto Insurance

There are six main categories of auto insurance, organized by the type of coverage they provide: **Liability Insurance**, **Collision Insurance**, **Comprehensive Insurance**, **Personal Injury Protection**, **Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist Insurance**, and **Full Coverage Insurance**.

## Main Categories
- **Liability Insurance** — covers damages to other people or property in an accident where the policyholder is at fault, as seen in **Geico's** liability insurance policies, which offer bodily injury and property damage coverage.
- **Collision Insurance** — pays for damages to the policyholder's vehicle in an accident, regardless of fault, with **State Farm** offering collision insurance that covers repairs or replacement of the vehicle.
- **Comprehensive Insurance** — covers non-collision damages, such as theft, vandalism, or natural disasters, with **Allstate** providing comprehensive insurance that includes coverage for glass damage and roadside assistance.
- **Personal Injury Protection** — covers medical expenses for the policyholder and their passengers, regardless of fault, as offered by **Progressive**, which includes coverage for lost wages and funeral expenses.
- **Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist Insurance** — protects the policyholder in an accident with someone who has inadequate or no insurance, with **Liberty Mutual** offering uninsured/underinsured motorist insurance that includes coverage for bodily injury and property damage.
- **Full Coverage Insurance** — combines liability, collision, and comprehensive coverage, with **USAA** offering full coverage insurance that includes additional features such as roadside assistance and rental car coverage.

## Comparison Table
| Category | Cost | Scale | Speed of Claims Processing |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Liability Insurance | lower | individual | 3-5 business days (Geico) |
| Collision Insurance | moderate | individual | 5-7 business days (State Farm) |
| Comprehensive Insurance | moderate | individual | 5-7 business days (Allstate) |
| Personal Injury Protection | higher | individual | 7-10 business days (Progressive) |
| Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist Insurance | lower | individual | 3-5 business days (Liberty Mutual) |
| Full Coverage Insurance | higher | individual | 7-10 business days (USAA) |

## How They Relate
The categories overlap in that **Liability Insurance** is often required by law, while **Collision Insurance** and **Comprehensive Insurance** are typically optional, but may be required by lenders. **Personal Injury Protection** and **Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist Insurance** are often bundled with **Liability Insurance**. **Full Coverage Insurance** combines multiple categories, including **Liability Insurance**, **Collision Insurance**, and **Comprehensive Insurance**. Specific pairs, such as **Collision Insurance** and **Comprehensive Insurance**, are commonly confused, but they serve distinct purposes, with **Collision Insurance** covering accidents and **Comprehensive Insurance** covering non-collision damages. Additionally, **Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist Insurance** and **Liability Insurance** are related, as they both provide protection in accidents, but **Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist Insurance** specifically addresses accidents with underinsured or uninsured drivers.
