  "content": "There are six main categories of auto insurance, organized by the type of coverage they provide: **Liability Insurance**, **Collision Insurance**, **Comprehensive Insurance**, **Personal Injury Protection**, **Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist Insurance**, and **Full Coverage Insurance**.\n\n## Main Categories\n- **Liability Insurance** \u2014 covers damages to other people or property in an accident where the policyholder is at fault, as seen in **Geico's** liability insurance policies, which offer bodily injury and property damage coverage.\n- **Collision Insurance** \u2014 pays for damages to the policyholder's vehicle in an accident, regardless of fault, with **State Farm** offering collision insurance that covers repairs or replacement of the vehicle.\n- **Comprehensive Insurance** \u2014 covers non-collision damages, such as theft, vandalism, or natural disasters, with **Allstate** providing comprehensive insurance that includes coverage for glass damage and roadside assistance.\n- **Personal Injury Protection** \u2014 covers medical expenses for the policyholder and their passengers, regardless of fault, as offered by **Progressive**, which includes coverage for lost wages and funeral expenses.\n- **Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist Insurance** \u2014 protects the policyholder in an accident with someone who has inadequate or no insurance, with **Liberty Mutual** offering uninsured/underinsured motorist insurance that includes coverage for bodily injury and property damage.\n- **Full Coverage Insurance** \u2014 combines liability, collision, and comprehensive coverage, with **USAA** offering full coverage insurance that includes additional features such as roadside assistance and rental car coverage.\n\n## Comparison Table\n| Category | Cost | Scale | Speed of Claims Processing |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Liability Insurance | lower | individual | 3-5 business days (Geico) |\n| Collision Insurance | moderate | individual | 5-7 business days (State Farm) |\n| Comprehensive Insurance | moderate | individual | 5-7 business days (Allstate) |\n| Personal Injury Protection | higher | individual | 7-10 business days (Progressive) |\n| Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist Insurance | lower | individual | 3-5 business days (Liberty Mutual) |\n| Full Coverage Insurance | higher | individual | 7-10 business days (USAA) |\n\n## How They Relate\nThe categories overlap in that **Liability Insurance** is often required by law, while **Collision Insurance** and **Comprehensive Insurance** are typically optional, but may be required by lenders. **Personal Injury Protection** and **Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist Insurance** are often bundled with **Liability Insurance**. **Full Coverage Insurance** combines multiple categories, including **Liability Insurance**, **Collision Insurance**, and **Comprehensive Insurance**. Specific pairs, such as **Collision Insurance** and **Comprehensive Insurance**, are commonly confused, but they serve distinct purposes, with **Collision Insurance** covering accidents and **Comprehensive Insurance** covering non-collision damages. Additionally, **Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist Insurance** and **Liability Insurance** are related, as they both provide protection in accidents, but **Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist Insurance** specifically addresses accidents with underinsured or uninsured drivers.",
