# Example of Auto Insurance

## Definition
Auto insurance is a type of financial protection that reimburses individuals for damages or losses incurred in an automobile accident, with the first modern insurance policy issued by **Travail Insurance Company** in 1898.

## How It Works
Auto insurance policies typically involve a contractual agreement between the insured and the insurer, where the insured pays a premium in exchange for financial protection against potential losses. The premium is calculated based on factors such as the driver's age, location, and driving history, with **actuarial tables** used to determine the likelihood of an accident. For example, a driver with a clean driving record and a low annual mileage may qualify for a lower premium, while a driver with a history of accidents or tickets may be charged a higher premium.

The insurance company uses the premiums collected from policyholders to pay for claims made by insured individuals, with the goal of maintaining a **loss ratio** of less than 100%. This means that for every dollar collected in premiums, the insurer pays out less than one dollar in claims, with the remaining amount used to cover administrative costs and generate profits. According to **State Farm's annual report**, the company paid out approximately $18.3 billion in auto insurance claims in 2020, while collecting $24.7 billion in premiums.

Auto insurance policies often involve a **deductible**, which is the amount the insured must pay out-of-pocket before the insurer begins to pay for damages. For example, if an insured individual has a $500 deductible and incurs $2,000 in damages, they would pay the first $500 and the insurer would pay the remaining $1,500. The deductible serves as a way to share the risk between the insured and the insurer, with higher deductibles typically resulting in lower premiums.

## Key Components
- **Liability coverage**: provides financial protection for damages or injuries caused to others in an accident, with minimum coverage limits varying by state, such as **California's** $15,000 bodily injury liability per person.
- **Collision coverage**: pays for damages to the insured's vehicle, regardless of fault, with the **Insurance Institute for Highway Safety** recommending a minimum of $500 in collision coverage.
- **Comprehensive coverage**: provides financial protection for damages or losses not related to an accident, such as theft or vandalism, with **Progressive Insurance** offering comprehensive coverage with a minimum deductible of $100.
- **Personal injury protection**: provides financial protection for medical expenses and lost wages resulting from an accident, with **New York's** no-fault insurance system requiring a minimum of $50,000 in personal injury protection coverage.
- **Uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage**: provides financial protection for damages or injuries caused by an uninsured or underinsured driver, with **Allstate** offering this coverage with a minimum limit of $25,000 per person.
- **Roadside assistance**: provides emergency services such as towing and lockout service, with **Geico** offering 24/7 roadside assistance with a minimum annual fee of $14.

## Common Misconceptions
**Myth:** Auto insurance premiums are determined solely by the driver's age and location. **Fact:** Premiums are determined by a combination of factors, including driving history, vehicle type, and annual mileage, as stated in **Liberty Mutual's** underwriting guidelines.
**Myth:** All auto insurance policies provide the same level of coverage. **Fact:** Coverage limits and deductibles vary by policy and insurer, with **USAA** offering customizable coverage options for military members and their families.
**Myth:** Auto insurance is not required by law. **Fact:** Most states require drivers to have a minimum amount of liability insurance, with **Texas** requiring a minimum of $30,000 in bodily injury liability per person.

## In Practice
In **Florida**, the average annual auto insurance premium is approximately $2,059, according to **Bankrate's** 2022 insurance survey. A driver in **Miami** with a clean driving record and a low annual mileage may qualify for a lower premium, such as **$1,500 per year** with **State Farm**, while a driver with a history of accidents or tickets may be charged a higher premium, such as **$3,000 per year** with **Progressive**. By understanding the key components of auto insurance and how they work, drivers can make informed decisions about their coverage and premiums.
