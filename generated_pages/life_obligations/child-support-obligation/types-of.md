# Types of Child Support Obligation

INTRODUCTION
Child support obligations are legal requirements for parents to provide financial support for their children, and understanding the different types of these obligations is essential for navigating the complexities of family law. The classification of child support obligations matters because it helps parents, lawyers, and judges determine the appropriate amount and type of support to be paid, taking into account factors such as income, custody arrangements, and the child's needs. By categorizing child support obligations, individuals can better comprehend their responsibilities and ensure that the child's well-being is prioritized. This classification system provides a framework for understanding the various types of child support obligations, their characteristics, and how they relate to one another.

MAIN CATEGORIES
There are several types of child support obligations, each with distinct characteristics and requirements. The main categories are:
- **Temporary Child Support**: Temporary child support is a type of support paid during a divorce or separation proceeding, intended to provide immediate financial assistance to the child. Key characteristics include court-ordered payments, typically made on a monthly basis, and the obligation to pay usually ends when a final child support order is issued. For example, if a couple is going through a divorce and one parent has primary custody of the child, the other parent may be required to pay temporary child support to help cover the child's living expenses.
- **Permanent Child Support**: Permanent child support, also known as ongoing child support, is a long-term obligation to provide financial support for a child until they reach a certain age or become self-sufficient. Key characteristics include regular payments, often made on a monthly basis, and the obligation to pay usually ends when the child reaches the age of majority or becomes emancipated. For instance, a non-custodial parent may be ordered to pay permanent child support to help cover the child's education, healthcare, and living expenses.
- **Rehabilitative Child Support**: Rehabilitative child support is a type of support paid to help a custodial parent become self-sufficient, usually by pursuing education or job training. Key characteristics include court-ordered payments, typically made for a limited period, and the obligation to pay usually ends when the custodial parent becomes employed or self-sufficient. For example, a custodial parent may receive rehabilitative child support to help them complete a degree or vocational training, enabling them to become financially independent.
- **Arrearage Payment**: An arrearage payment is a payment made to satisfy a past-due child support obligation, often resulting from missed or late payments. Key characteristics include a lump-sum payment or a payment plan, and the obligation to pay usually ends when the arrearage is satisfied. For instance, a non-custodial parent who has fallen behind on child support payments may be required to make an arrearage payment to bring their account up to date.
- **Voluntary Child Support**: Voluntary child support is a payment made by a parent without a court order, often as part of a private agreement between parents. Key characteristics include informal arrangements, variable payment amounts, and the obligation to pay is usually based on mutual agreement. For example, a non-custodial parent may choose to pay voluntary child support to help cover the child's expenses, even if there is no court order requiring them to do so.

COMPARISON TABLE
The following table summarizes the main differences between the types of child support obligations:
| Type | Duration | Payment Frequency | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Temporary | Limited | Monthly | Immediate financial assistance |
| Permanent | Long-term | Monthly | Ongoing financial support |
| Rehabilitative | Limited | Monthly | Help custodial parent become self-sufficient |
| Arrearage | One-time or payment plan | Lump sum or installment | Satisfy past-due obligation |
| Voluntary | Variable | Variable | Mutual agreement between parents |

HOW THEY RELATE
The categories of child support obligations are interconnected, as they often overlap or follow one another in sequence. For instance, temporary child support may be paid during a divorce proceeding, followed by permanent child support once the divorce is finalized. Rehabilitative child support may be paid in conjunction with permanent child support, and arrearage payments may be made to satisfy past-due obligations. Voluntary child support, on the other hand, is a separate arrangement that may be made outside of the court system.

SUMMARY
The classification system for child support obligations encompasses various types, including temporary, permanent, rehabilitative, arrearage, and voluntary support, each with distinct characteristics and purposes that work together to ensure the financial well-being of children.
