1. INTRODUCTION: 
Personal loans are a common financial tool used by individuals to cover various expenses. However, there are many misconceptions surrounding personal loans that can lead to confusion and poor decision-making. These misconceptions often arise from a lack of understanding about how personal loans work, as well as misinformation from unreliable sources. As a result, it is essential to separate fact from fiction to make informed decisions when considering a personal loan.

2. MISCONCEPTION LIST:

  Reality: Most personal loans are unsecured, meaning they do not require collateral.
  Why people believe this: This misconception may be due to the fact that some loans, such as mortgages and auto loans, do require collateral. However, personal loans are typically unsecured, and the lender relies on the borrower's creditworthiness to determine the loan terms.
