        <h1>Example of Pension</h1>

        

        <p>1. INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>A pension is a type of financial arrangement where an employer agrees to pay a certain amount of money to an employee after they retire. This money is usually paid out in regular installments, such as monthly payments, and is intended to provide the retiree with a source of income during their retirement years. Pensions can be found in a wide range of contexts, from small businesses to large corporations, and from government agencies to non-profit organizations.</p>

<p>2. EVERYDAY EXAMPLES</p>
<p>Many people are familiar with pensions through their own workplaces or families. For example, a teacher may receive a pension from their school district after 30 years of service, with a monthly payment of $2,000. A factory worker may receive a pension from their union, with a payment of $1,500 per month after 25 years of service. A small business owner may set up a pension plan for themselves and their employees, with a payment of $1,000 per month after 20 years of service. A government employee, such as a police officer or firefighter, may receive a pension from their city or state, with a payment of $3,000 per month after 25 years of service.</p>

<p>3. NOTABLE EXAMPLES</p>
<p>Some well-known examples of pensions include the pension plans offered by large corporations such as IBM and General Motors. These plans often provide generous benefits to long-serving employees, such as a guaranteed minimum payment of $2,500 per month after 30 years of service. Another notable example is the pension plan offered by the US military, which provides a guaranteed payment of $2,000 per month to retired service members after 20 years of service. The California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) is also a notable example, providing pensions to hundreds of thousands of state and local government employees.</p>

<p>4. EDGE CASES</p>
<p>Pensions can also be found in unusual or unexpected contexts. For example, some professional athletes, such as football players or baseball players, may receive pensions from their leagues or teams after they retire from competition. These pensions can be quite generous, with payments of $5,000 or more per month. Another edge case is the pension plan offered by some non-profit organizations, such as museums or charities, which may provide pensions to their employees as a way of attracting and retaining top talent.</p>

<p>5. NON-EXAMPLES</p>
<p>Some things that people often confuse with pensions are not actually pensions at all. For example, a 401(k) or IRA is a type of retirement savings plan, but it is not a pension. These plans allow employees to save for retirement on their own, but they do not provide a guaranteed payment from an employer. Another non-example is a Social Security benefit, which is a government-funded program that provides income to retired workers, but it is not a pension. A third non-example is a lump-sum severance payment, which may be given to an employee when they leave a company, but it is not a regular, ongoing payment like a pension.</p>

<p>6. PATTERN</p>
<p>Despite the wide range of contexts and scales in which pensions can be found, all valid examples have one thing in common: a commitment by an employer to pay a certain amount of money to an employee after they retire. This commitment is usually based on the employee's years of service and salary, and it is intended to provide the retiree with a source of income during their retirement years. Whether it is a small business owner setting up a pension plan for themselves and their employees, or a large corporation offering a generous pension plan to its long-serving employees, the underlying principle is the same: to provide a guaranteed income stream to retired workers. This pattern is what defines a pension and distinguishes it from other types of retirement plans or benefits.</p>
