# What is Types Of Insurance Deductible?

## INTRODUCTION
Insurance deductibles are amounts that policyholders must pay out of pocket before their insurance coverage kicks in. Classifying types of insurance deductibles is essential because it helps individuals and businesses understand their financial obligations and make informed decisions when selecting insurance policies. A comprehensive classification system enables users to navigate the complex world of insurance deductibles, ensuring they are aware of the various types and their implications. By understanding the different categories of insurance deductibles, individuals can better manage their expenses and choose the most suitable insurance plans for their needs.

## MAIN CATEGORIES
The following are the primary types of insurance deductibles:
1. **Per-Occurrence Deductible**
   - Definition: A per-occurrence deductible is the amount paid by the policyholder for each incident or claim. This type of deductible applies to individual events, such as accidents or natural disasters.
   - Key characteristics: Applies to each separate incident, may vary depending on the type of insurance and policy.
   - Example: If a driver has a per-occurrence deductible of $500 and is involved in two separate car accidents, they will pay $500 for each accident.
2. **Per-Policy Deductible**
   - Definition: A per-policy deductible is the total amount paid by the policyholder during the policy period, regardless of the number of claims filed. This type of deductible is typically applied to the entire policy, not individual incidents.
   - Key characteristics: Applies to the overall policy, may be lower than per-occurrence deductibles, and can provide cost savings for policyholders with multiple claims.
   - Example: If a homeowner has a per-policy deductible of $1,000 and files two claims within the policy period, they will only pay $1,000 in total, not $2,000.
3. **Aggregate Deductible**
   - Definition: An aggregate deductible is the total amount paid by the policyholder during the policy period, accumulated across multiple claims. This type of deductible is often used in commercial insurance policies.
   - Key characteristics: Accumulates across multiple claims, applies to the overall policy, and can provide cost savings for policyholders with multiple claims.
   - Example: If a business has an aggregate deductible of $5,000 and files three claims with deductibles of $1,000, $1,500, and $2,500, they will pay a total of $5,000, which is the aggregate deductible.
4. **Franchise Deductible**
   - Definition: A franchise deductible is a type of deductible where the policyholder pays a fixed amount for each claim, and the insurance company pays the remaining amount. This type of deductible is often used in liability insurance policies.
   - Key characteristics: Fixed amount paid by the policyholder, insurance company pays the remaining amount, and can provide cost savings for policyholders.
   - Example: If a policyholder has a franchise deductible of $1,000 and files a claim for $10,000, they will pay $1,000, and the insurance company will pay $9,000.
5. **Split Deductible**
   - Definition: A split deductible is a type of deductible where the policyholder pays a percentage of the claim amount, and the insurance company pays the remaining percentage. This type of deductible is often used in property insurance policies.
   - Key characteristics: Policyholder pays a percentage of the claim amount, insurance company pays the remaining percentage, and can provide cost savings for policyholders.
   - Example: If a policyholder has a split deductible of 20% and files a claim for $10,000, they will pay $2,000 (20% of $10,000), and the insurance company will pay $8,000 (80% of $10,000).

## COMPARISON TABLE
The following table summarizes the differences between the main categories of insurance deductibles:
| Type of Deductible | Definition | Key Characteristics | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Per-Occurrence | Amount paid for each incident | Applies to each separate incident | $500 per accident |
| Per-Policy | Total amount paid during the policy period | Applies to the overall policy, may be lower than per-occurrence | $1,000 per policy period |
| Aggregate | Total amount paid during the policy period, accumulated across multiple claims | Accumulates across multiple claims, applies to the overall policy | $5,000 aggregate deductible |

| Split | Percentage of the claim amount paid by the policyholder | Policyholder pays a percentage of the claim amount, insurance company pays the remaining percentage | 20% split deductible |

## HOW THEY RELATE
The different types of insurance deductibles are connected in that they all serve the purpose of sharing the risk between the policyholder and the insurance company. While they have distinct characteristics, they can be used in combination or separately to provide flexible insurance options for policyholders. For instance, a policy may have a per-occurrence deductible for certain types of claims and a per-policy deductible for others. Understanding how these deductibles relate to each other is crucial for policyholders to make informed decisions about their insurance coverage.

## SUMMARY
The classification system for types of insurance deductibles includes per-occurrence, per-policy, aggregate, franchise, and split deductibles, each with its unique characteristics and applications, providing a framework for understanding the various ways in which insurance policies can be structured to share risk between policyholders and insurance companies.
