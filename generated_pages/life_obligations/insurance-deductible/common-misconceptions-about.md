# What is Common Misconceptions About Insurance Deductible?

1. INTRODUCTION:
Misconceptions about insurance deductibles are common because the concept can be confusing. An insurance deductible is the amount of money you must pay out of pocket before your insurance coverage kicks in. Many people misunderstand how deductibles work, which can lead to unexpected expenses and financial stress. This confusion often arises from a lack of understanding of insurance policies and how they are structured. By clarifying common misconceptions, individuals can make more informed decisions about their insurance coverage.

2. MISCONCEPTION LIST:
- **Myth:** You have to pay your deductible every time you visit a doctor or hospital.
  **Reality:** You typically only pay your deductible once per year, or per claim, depending on your insurance policy. After that, you usually pay a copayment or coinsurance for subsequent visits.
  **Why people believe this:** The term "deductible" might imply that it's a payment due at every medical visit, rather than an annual or per-claim threshold that must be met before insurance coverage begins.
- **Myth:** Your deductible applies to all types of medical services.
  **Reality:** Some services, like preventive care visits or screenings, may be covered without requiring you to pay your deductible.
  **Why people believe this:** Insurance policies can be complex, with varying levels of coverage for different services, leading to misunderstandings about what is and isn't subject to the deductible.
- **Myth:** If you have a high deductible, you can't afford to use your insurance.
  **Reality:** While a high deductible means you pay more out of pocket initially, it often results in lower monthly premiums. It's essential to weigh the costs and benefits based on your health needs and financial situation.
  **Why people believe this:** The initial higher expense of a high deductible can be daunting, leading some to believe that such plans are unaffordable or not worth using.
- **Myth:** All insurance plans have the same deductible structure.
  **Reality:** Different insurance plans can have significantly varying deductible structures, including the amount, what services it applies to, and how it accumulates.
  **Why people believe this:** With so many insurance options available, it can be challenging to keep track of the specifics of each plan, leading to assumptions that they are more similar than they actually are.
- **Myth:** You can change your deductible at any time.
  **Reality:** Typically, you can only change your deductible during the open enrollment period or under specific circumstances, such as a qualifying life event.
  **Why people believe this:** The flexibility to adjust other aspects of insurance, like provider networks, might lead to the misconception that deductibles can be changed at will.
- **Myth:** A deductible is the same as a copayment.
  **Reality:** A deductible is the amount you pay before your insurance starts covering costs, whereas a copayment is a fixed amount you pay for a specific service after meeting your deductible.
  **Why people believe this:** The terminology used in insurance policies can be confusing, especially for those new to navigating health insurance.
- **Myth:** Having a deductible means you're not fully insured.
  **Reality:** A deductible is a standard component of many insurance plans, designed to share the cost of care between you and your insurer. It does not indicate a lack of coverage.
  **Why people believe this:** The requirement to pay a deductible might lead some to feel that their insurance is incomplete or inadequate.

3. HOW TO REMEMBER:
To avoid these misconceptions, it's helpful to carefully review your insurance policy documents, ask questions if you're unsure, and consider seeking advice from an insurance professional. Understanding the specifics of your deductible, including how it applies to different services and what you pay after meeting it, can help you navigate your insurance coverage more effectively.

4. SUMMARY:
The key to avoiding confusion about insurance deductibles is to remember that they are a threshold that must be met before your insurance coverage kicks in, and they do not apply to every medical service or visit. By understanding how your deductible works and what it covers, you can make informed decisions about your health care and avoid unexpected expenses.
