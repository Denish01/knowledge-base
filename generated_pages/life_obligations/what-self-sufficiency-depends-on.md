# What Self Sufficiency Depends On

1. INTRODUCTION:
Self-sufficiency refers to the ability of an individual or community to provide for their own needs without relying on external sources. Understanding what self-sufficiency depends on is crucial, as it highlights the essential prerequisites and foundations required to achieve this state. By recognizing these dependencies, individuals can better prepare themselves and make informed decisions to work towards self-sufficiency. The dependencies that underpin self-sufficiency are critical, as they determine the feasibility and sustainability of independent living.

2. KEY DEPENDENCIES:
- **Financial Resources**: Self-sufficiency requires a stable financial foundation, enabling individuals to invest in essential tools, equipment, and infrastructure. Without sufficient financial resources, individuals may struggle to acquire the necessary means to support themselves, leading to dependency on external aid. 
- **Adequate Knowledge and Skills**: Acquiring a range of skills, including food production, first aid, and repair work, is necessary for self-sufficiency. Without these skills, individuals may be unable to maintain their independence, forcing them to rely on others for support. 
- **Reliable Access to Natural Resources**: Self-sufficiency depends on access to natural resources such as water, land, and energy. Without these resources, individuals may be unable to produce their own food, collect water, or generate power, making self-sufficiency impossible.
- **Suitable Infrastructure**: A well-designed and functional infrastructure, including shelter, storage, and waste management, is necessary for self-sufficiency. Without proper infrastructure, individuals may be exposed to health risks, and their ability to store and manage resources may be compromised.
- **Resilience and Adaptability**: Self-sufficiency requires the ability to adapt to changing circumstances, including environmental disasters and economic shifts. Without resilience and adaptability, individuals may be unable to cope with unexpected challenges, leading to a loss of independence.

3. ORDER OF IMPORTANCE:
While all dependencies are crucial, financial resources and reliable access to natural resources are the most critical. These two dependencies provide the foundation for self-sufficiency, enabling individuals to acquire the necessary tools and resources to support themselves. Adequate knowledge and skills, as well as suitable infrastructure, are also essential, but they can be developed and improved over time. Resilience and adaptability are vital for long-term sustainability, as they enable individuals to respond to unexpected challenges and maintain their independence.

4. COMMON GAPS:
Individuals often overlook the importance of financial planning and resource management when working towards self-sufficiency. Many assume that they can simply "live off the land" without considering the need for a stable financial foundation. Others may underestimate the importance of acquiring practical skills, such as food preservation and repair work, leading to a reliance on external sources for support.

5. SUMMARY:
Self-sufficiency depends on a range of essential prerequisites and foundations, including financial resources, adequate knowledge and skills, reliable access to natural resources, suitable infrastructure, and resilience and adaptability. By recognizing and addressing these dependencies, individuals can create a solid foundation for independent living and work towards achieving self-sufficiency. A thorough understanding of these dependencies is crucial for making informed decisions and developing effective strategies for self-sufficient living.
