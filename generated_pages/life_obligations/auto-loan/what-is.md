# What Is Auto Loan?

## Definition
Auto loan is a type of **consumer credit** that allows individuals to borrow money from a lender to purchase a vehicle, with the loan being secured by the vehicle itself, a concept rooted in **secured lending** principles.

## How It Works
The auto loan process typically begins with a borrower applying for a loan from a lender, such as a bank or **credit union**, and providing financial information, including income, credit score, and debt-to-income ratio. The lender then evaluates the borrower's creditworthiness and determines the loan amount, interest rate, and repayment terms, often using **FICO credit scores** as a benchmark. For example, a borrower with a good credit score may qualify for a lower interest rate, such as 4.5%, and a longer repayment term, such as 60 months, resulting in a lower monthly payment of $300.

The repayment terms of an auto loan are typically structured as a series of fixed monthly payments, with the borrower making payments over a set period, such as 36 or 60 months. During this time, the borrower is required to make timely payments, and the lender may charge **late fees** and **penalties** for missed or late payments. According to **Experian**, the average auto loan debt per borrower is approximately $31,000, with an average interest rate of 5.3%. To mitigate risk, lenders often require borrowers to purchase **gap insurance**, which covers the difference between the loan balance and the vehicle's actual cash value in the event of a total loss.

Auto loans can be categorized into different types, including **simple interest loans** and **precomputed interest loans**. Simple interest loans calculate interest on the outstanding loan balance, while precomputed interest loans calculate interest on the original loan amount. For instance, a borrower with a simple interest loan may save money on interest payments if they pay off the loan early, as the interest accrues only on the remaining balance. In contrast, precomputed interest loans often have higher interest rates and stricter repayment terms.

## Key Components
- **Interest Rate**: The interest rate on an auto loan determines the cost of borrowing, with higher interest rates resulting in higher monthly payments and total interest paid over the life of the loan. For example, a 1% increase in interest rate can increase the total interest paid by $500 over the life of a $20,000 loan.
- **Loan Term**: The loan term, or repayment period, affects the monthly payment amount and total interest paid, with longer loan terms resulting in lower monthly payments but higher total interest paid. A 60-month loan term may result in a lower monthly payment of $300, but a higher total interest paid of $5,000.
- **Down Payment**: The down payment, or initial payment, reduces the loan amount and monthly payments, with larger down payments resulting in lower monthly payments and total interest paid. A 20% down payment on a $20,000 loan can reduce the monthly payment by $100 and the total interest paid by $2,000.
- **Credit Score**: The borrower's credit score affects the interest rate and loan terms, with good credit scores resulting in lower interest rates and better loan terms. Borrowers with excellent credit scores, such as 750 or higher, may qualify for interest rates as low as 3.5%.
- **Collateral**: The vehicle itself serves as collateral for the loan, with the lender having the right to repossess the vehicle if the borrower defaults on the loan. Lenders may also require borrowers to purchase **comprehensive insurance** and **collision insurance** to protect the collateral.
- **Fees**: Auto loans may include various fees, such as **origination fees**, **title fees**, and **registration fees**, which increase the total cost of the loan. These fees can range from $100 to $500, depending on the lender and loan terms.

## Common Misconceptions
**Myth:** Auto loans are always secured by the vehicle itself — **Fact:** While auto loans are typically secured by the vehicle, some lenders may offer **unsecured auto loans** or **personal loans** for vehicle purchases, which do not require collateral (Chase Bank).
**Myth:** Auto loan interest rates are always fixed — **Fact:** Some auto loans may have **variable interest rates**, which can change over the life of the loan, resulting in higher or lower monthly payments (Bank of America).
**Myth:** Auto loan terms are always 36 or 60 months — **Fact:** Auto loan terms can vary, with some lenders offering **72-month** or **84-month** loan terms, which can result in lower monthly payments but higher total interest paid (Wells Fargo).
**Myth:** Auto loan credit scores are not important — **Fact:** Credit scores play a significant role in determining auto loan interest rates and terms, with good credit scores resulting in lower interest rates and better loan terms (FICO).

## In Practice
In the United States, the **Federal Trade Commission** regulates auto loan practices, including **truth-in-lending** disclosures and **deceptive advertising**. For example, a borrower purchasing a $30,000 vehicle from **General Motors** may qualify for a 60-month auto loan with a 5.5% interest rate and a monthly payment of $566. The borrower's credit score, loan term, and down payment will all impact the total interest paid over the life of the loan, with a good credit score and larger down payment resulting in lower total interest paid. According to **Ford Motor Company**, the average auto loan debt per borrower is approximately $32,000, with an average interest rate of 5.8%.
