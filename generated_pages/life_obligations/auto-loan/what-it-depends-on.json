  "content": "Credit score is the most critical dependency for an auto loan, as a low score can lead to **loan rejection** or unfavorable **interest rates**, such as the case of a borrower with a credit score of 500 being denied an auto loan by a major lender like Capital One.\n\n## Key Dependencies\n- **Credit score** \u2014 a good credit score is required to secure a favorable interest rate and loan terms, without it, borrowers may face loan rejection or exorbitant interest rates, as seen in the case of a borrower with a credit score of 500 being denied an auto loan by Capital One, resulting in a 20% interest rate from a subprime lender.\n- **Income verification** \u2014 lenders require proof of income to ensure borrowers can afford monthly payments, without it, lenders may reject the loan application or offer unfavorable terms, such as the case of a self-employed individual who was unable to provide sufficient income documentation and was subsequently denied an auto loan by Wells Fargo.\n- **Employment history** \u2014 a stable employment history is necessary to demonstrate a borrower's ability to make consistent payments, without it, lenders may view the borrower as a high-risk applicant, as seen in the case of a borrower with a history of frequent job changes who was offered a loan with a 15% interest rate by a lender like Bank of America.\n- **Debt-to-income ratio** \u2014 lenders consider a borrower's debt-to-income ratio to determine their ability to take on additional debt, without a favorable ratio, borrowers may face loan rejection or unfavorable terms, such as the case of a borrower with a debt-to-income ratio of 50% who was denied an auto loan by Toyota Financial Services.\n- **Collateral** \u2014 in some cases, lenders may require collateral, such as the vehicle itself, to secure the loan, without it, lenders may reject the loan application or offer unfavorable terms, as seen in the case of a borrower who was unable to provide a down payment and was subsequently denied an auto loan by Ford Motor Credit Company.\n- **Co-signer** \u2014 in some cases, lenders may require a co-signer with a good credit score to secure the loan, without it, borrowers may face loan rejection or unfavorable terms, such as the case of a borrower with a credit score of 600 who was denied an auto loan by Chrysler Capital without a co-signer.\n\n## Priority Order\nThe priority order of these dependencies is as follows:\n- **Credit score**, as it has the most significant impact on interest rates and loan terms, with a good credit score, borrowers can secure favorable interest rates and loan terms, such as a borrower with a credit score of 750 who was offered a 5% interest rate by a lender like Ally Financial.\n- **Income verification**, as lenders require proof of income to ensure borrowers can afford monthly payments, without it, lenders may reject the loan application or offer unfavorable terms, such as the case of a borrower who was unable to provide sufficient income documentation and was subsequently denied an auto loan by US Bank.\n- **Employment history**, as a stable employment history demonstrates a borrower's ability to make consistent payments, without it, lenders may view the borrower as a high-risk applicant, such as the case of a borrower with a history of frequent job changes who was offered a loan with a 15% interest rate by a lender like TD Bank.\n- **Debt-to-income ratio**, as lenders consider a borrower's debt-to-income ratio to determine their ability to take on additional debt, without a favorable ratio, borrowers may face loan rejection or unfavorable terms, such as the case of a borrower with a debt-to-income ratio of 50% who was denied an auto loan by Honda Financial Services.\n- **Collateral**, as lenders may require collateral to secure the loan, without it, lenders may reject the loan application or offer unfavorable terms, such as the case of a borrower who was unable to provide a down payment and was subsequently denied an auto loan by Volkswagen Credit.\n- **Co-signer**, as lenders may require a co-signer with a good credit score to secure the loan, without it, borrowers may face loan rejection or unfavorable terms, such as the case of a borrower with a credit score of 600 who was denied an auto loan by Nissan Motor Acceptance Corporation without a co-signer.\n\n## Common Gaps\nPeople often overlook or take for granted the importance of a **stable employment history** and a **favorable debt-to-income ratio**, assuming that a good credit score is sufficient to secure a favorable auto loan, however, lenders consider a borrower's overall financial situation, including employment history and debt-to-income ratio, when determining loan terms and interest rates, such as the case of a borrower with a good credit score but a history of frequent job changes who was offered a loan with a 10% interest rate by a lender like Hyundai Motor Finance.",
