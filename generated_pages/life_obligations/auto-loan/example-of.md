# Example of Auto Loan

## Definition
An auto loan is a type of **secured loan** that allows individuals to purchase a vehicle by borrowing money from a lender, with the vehicle serving as collateral, originating from the concept of lending with collateral, which dates back to ancient civilizations.

## How It Works
The auto loan process typically begins with a borrower applying for a loan from a financial institution, such as a bank or credit union, with the lender evaluating the borrower's **credit score** and **debt-to-income ratio** to determine the loan's terms, including the **interest rate** and **loan tenure**. According to Ricardo's comparative advantage model, lenders specialize in lending to maximize their returns, and auto loans are a significant portion of their portfolio. For instance, **Bank of America** issues over $10 billion in auto loans annually, with an average loan amount of $25,000 and an average interest rate of 6% (Bank of America annual report).

The lender will also consider the vehicle's **make**, **model**, and **year** to determine its value and the loan's **loan-to-value ratio**, which is typically around 80% of the vehicle's purchase price. The borrower will then make monthly payments, known as **installments**, which include both **principal** and **interest**, with the interest calculated using the **simple interest formula**. As the borrower makes payments, the loan's **outstanding balance** decreases, and the borrower builds **equity** in the vehicle.

Auto loans can be categorized into different types, including **fixed-rate loans** and **variable-rate loans**, with fixed-rate loans offering a fixed interest rate for the entire loan tenure, while variable-rate loans have an interest rate that can change over time, based on market conditions. For example, **Toyota Financial Services** offers a fixed-rate auto loan with an interest rate of 5% for a 5-year loan tenure, with a monthly payment of $375 (Toyota Financial Services website).

## Key Components
- **Interest Rate**: The interest rate determines the cost of borrowing and affects the monthly payment amount, with higher interest rates resulting in higher monthly payments, and lower interest rates resulting in lower monthly payments.
- **Loan Tenure**: The loan tenure affects the monthly payment amount and the total interest paid over the life of the loan, with longer loan tenures resulting in lower monthly payments but higher total interest paid.
- **Loan-to-Value Ratio**: The loan-to-value ratio determines the amount of the loan relative to the vehicle's value, with higher loan-to-value ratios resulting in higher monthly payments and higher risk for the lender.
- **Credit Score**: The credit score affects the interest rate and loan terms, with higher credit scores resulting in lower interest rates and better loan terms.
- **Debt-to-Income Ratio**: The debt-to-income ratio affects the borrower's ability to repay the loan, with higher debt-to-income ratios resulting in higher risk for the lender.
- **Collateral**: The collateral, in this case, the vehicle, secures the loan and reduces the risk for the lender, with the lender able to repossess the vehicle if the borrower defaults on the loan.

## Common Misconceptions
**Myth:** Auto loans are only available from banks and credit unions — **Fact:** Auto loans are also available from **online lenders**, such as **LendingTree**, and **captive finance companies**, such as **Ford Motor Credit**.
**Myth:** Auto loans have a fixed interest rate for the entire loan tenure — **Fact:** Some auto loans, such as **variable-rate loans**, have an interest rate that can change over time, based on market conditions.
**Myth:** Auto loans require a 20% down payment — **Fact:** Many auto loans require a lower down payment, such as 10% or 5%, with some lenders offering **zero-down loans**.
**Myth:** Auto loans are only available for new vehicles — **Fact:** Auto loans are also available for **used vehicles**, with some lenders specializing in **used vehicle financing**.

## In Practice
In the United States, **General Motors** offers an auto loan program through its **GM Financial** subsidiary, with an average loan amount of $30,000 and an average interest rate of 7% (GM Financial annual report). For example, a borrower purchasing a **2022 Chevrolet Silverado** with a purchase price of $40,000 and a down payment of $5,000 can obtain an auto loan with a loan amount of $35,000, an interest rate of 6%, and a loan tenure of 5 years, with a monthly payment of $645 (GM Financial website). The borrower's credit score and debt-to-income ratio will affect the loan's terms, with a higher credit score and lower debt-to-income ratio resulting in a lower interest rate and better loan terms.
