# Auto Loan Compared

## Definition
Auto Loan Compared is a financial analysis tool that refers to the process of evaluating and contrasting different auto loan options, considering factors such as interest rates, loan terms, and repayment schedules, as described by financial expert David Bach in his book "The Automatic Millionaire", 2004.

## How It Works
The auto loan comparison process involves calculating the total cost of each loan option, including the principal amount, interest charges, and any additional fees, using formulas such as the **time value of money** framework. For instance, a borrower considering a $20,000 auto loan with a 5% interest rate and a 5-year repayment term would calculate the total cost of the loan, including interest, to be around $23,273 (CalculatorWeb). This calculation allows borrowers to compare the costs of different loan options and choose the one that best suits their financial situation. The **loan-to-value ratio**, which is the percentage of the vehicle's purchase price that is financed, also plays a significant role in determining the total cost of the loan. According to the National Automobile Dealers Association, the average loan-to-value ratio for new vehicles is around 80% (NADA).

The comparison process also involves evaluating the **credit score** requirements for each loan option, as lenders use credit scores to determine the borrower's creditworthiness and set the interest rate accordingly. For example, a borrower with a **FICO credit score** of 700 or higher may qualify for a lower interest rate than a borrower with a credit score of 600 (FICO). Additionally, lenders may offer different **loan terms**, such as 3-year, 5-year, or 7-year repayment periods, which can affect the borrower's monthly payment amount and the total cost of the loan. According to Bankrate, the average monthly payment for a $20,000 auto loan with a 5% interest rate and a 5-year repayment term is around $377 (Bankrate).

The auto loan comparison process can be facilitated by online tools and calculators, such as those offered by **Kelley Blue Book** or **Edmunds**, which provide borrowers with a comprehensive view of their loan options and help them make informed decisions. These tools can also help borrowers to identify potential **prepayment penalties**, which are fees charged by lenders for paying off the loan early, and to evaluate the **refinancing options** available to them. For instance, a borrower who has improved their credit score since taking out the original loan may be able to refinance the loan at a lower interest rate, reducing their monthly payment amount and the total cost of the loan.

## Key Components
- **Interest Rate**: The interest rate is the percentage of the loan amount that the borrower is charged as interest over the life of the loan, and it can significantly affect the total cost of the loan. A higher interest rate increases the borrower's monthly payment amount and the total cost of the loan.
- **Loan Term**: The loan term is the length of time that the borrower has to repay the loan, and it can affect the borrower's monthly payment amount and the total cost of the loan. A longer loan term may result in lower monthly payments, but it can also increase the total cost of the loan.
- **Credit Score**: The credit score is a measure of the borrower's creditworthiness, and it can affect the interest rate that the borrower is offered and the loan terms. A higher credit score can result in a lower interest rate and more favorable loan terms.
- **Loan-to-Value Ratio**: The loan-to-value ratio is the percentage of the vehicle's purchase price that is financed, and it can affect the borrower's monthly payment amount and the total cost of the loan. A higher loan-to-value ratio may result in higher monthly payments and a higher total cost of the loan.
- **Prepayment Penalties**: Prepayment penalties are fees charged by lenders for paying off the loan early, and they can affect the borrower's decision to refinance the loan or pay it off early. A borrower who expects to pay off the loan early should consider a loan with no prepayment penalties.
- **Refinancing Options**: Refinancing options are available to borrowers who have improved their credit score or who want to take advantage of lower interest rates, and they can affect the borrower's monthly payment amount and the total cost of the loan. A borrower who has improved their credit score may be able to refinance the loan at a lower interest rate, reducing their monthly payment amount and the total cost of the loan.

## Common Misconceptions
**Myth:** Auto loans with longer repayment terms are always more expensive than those with shorter repayment terms — **Fact:** While longer repayment terms may result in lower monthly payments, they can also increase the total cost of the loan, as the borrower is paying interest over a longer period (Bankrate).
**Myth:** All auto loans have prepayment penalties — **Fact:** Not all auto loans have prepayment penalties, and some lenders may offer loans with no prepayment penalties, allowing borrowers to pay off the loan early without incurring additional fees (Credit Karma).
**Myth:** Auto loan interest rates are always fixed — **Fact:** Some auto loans may have variable interest rates, which can increase or decrease over the life of the loan, affecting the borrower's monthly payment amount and the total cost of the loan (Federal Reserve).
**Myth:** Borrowers with poor credit cannot get approved for an auto loan — **Fact:** While borrowers with poor credit may face higher interest rates and less favorable loan terms, they can still get approved for an auto loan, and some lenders specialize in offering loans to borrowers with poor credit (Experian).

## In Practice
In the United States, the average auto loan amount is around $31,000, and the average interest rate is around 5.5% (Experian). For example, a borrower in California who is purchasing a new vehicle with a price tag of $30,000 may consider a 5-year auto loan with a 5% interest rate and a monthly payment of around $566 (Edmunds). If the borrower has a credit score of 700 or higher, they may qualify for a lower interest rate, such as 4.5%, which would reduce their monthly payment to around $541 (FICO). Additionally, the borrower may want to consider refinancing the loan after a few years, if they have improved their credit score or if interest rates have decreased, to take advantage of more favorable loan terms and reduce their monthly payment amount.
