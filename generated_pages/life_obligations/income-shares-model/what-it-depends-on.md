# What Income Shares Model Depends On

1. INTRODUCTION
The income shares model is a method used to calculate the amount of child support one parent must pay to the other. It is based on the income of both parents and the amount of time each parent spends with the child. Understanding the dependencies of the income shares model is crucial, as it helps ensure that child support calculations are fair and accurate. The model's effectiveness relies on various prerequisites, requirements, and foundations, which are essential for its proper functioning.

2. KEY DEPENDENCIES
The income shares model depends on several key factors, including:
- Accurate income information: This is necessary to determine the correct amount of child support. Without accurate income information, the model may produce incorrect results, leading to unfair or inadequate child support payments.
- Reliable expense data: This includes expenses related to the child, such as education, healthcare, and extracurricular activities. Reliable expense data is necessary to ensure that the child's needs are met. Without it, the model may not account for all the child's expenses, resulting in inadequate support.
- Custody arrangements: The income shares model takes into account the amount of time each parent spends with the child. This information is necessary to determine the correct amount of child support. Without accurate custody arrangements, the model may produce incorrect results, leading to unfair or inadequate child support payments.
- Tax filing status: The model considers the tax filing status of each parent, as this affects their income and expenses. Without accurate tax filing status information, the model may produce incorrect results, leading to unfair or inadequate child support payments.
- Financial records: This includes records of income, expenses, and assets. Financial records are necessary to verify the accuracy of the information used in the model. Without them, the model may rely on incomplete or inaccurate data, resulting in incorrect results.

3. ORDER OF IMPORTANCE
While all the dependencies are crucial, accurate income information and reliable expense data are the most critical. These two factors directly affect the calculation of child support and have the greatest impact on the model's results. Custody arrangements and tax filing status are also important, as they influence the amount of time each parent spends with the child and their respective financial obligations. Financial records provide a foundation for verifying the accuracy of the information used in the model, making them essential for ensuring the model's reliability.

4. COMMON GAPS
People often overlook the importance of accurate financial records or assume that the model can function without them. However, incomplete or inaccurate financial records can lead to incorrect results, making it essential to ensure that all financial information is accurate and up-to-date. Additionally, some individuals may not fully understand the impact of custody arrangements on child support calculations, which can lead to disputes or incorrect results.

5. SUMMARY
The income shares model relies on a foundation of accurate and reliable information, including income, expenses, custody arrangements, tax filing status, and financial records. These prerequisites are essential for ensuring that child support calculations are fair and accurate. By understanding the dependencies of the income shares model, individuals can ensure that they provide complete and accurate information, resulting in a more reliable and effective child support calculation. The key to the model's success lies in its foundation, making it essential to prioritize the collection and verification of accurate and reliable data.
