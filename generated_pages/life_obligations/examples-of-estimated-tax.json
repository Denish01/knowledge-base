INTRODUCTION:\nEstimated tax refers to the process of paying taxes on income that is not subject to withholding, such as self-employment income, investment income, or income from a side job. The goal of estimated tax is to ensure that individuals and businesses are paying their fair share of taxes throughout the year, rather than all at once when they file their tax return. This helps to avoid penalties and interest that can accrue when taxes are paid late.\n\n2. EVERYDAY EXAMPLES:\nMany people are required to pay estimated tax, including freelancers, independent contractors, and small business owners. For example, Sarah is a freelance writer who earns $50,000 per year from her writing services. Since she does not have an employer to withhold taxes from her income, she is required to make estimated tax payments each quarter to the government. Another example is John, who owns a small landscaping business and earns $75,000 per year. He must also make estimated tax payments to account for his business income. Additionally, Emily, a retired teacher, earns $20,000 per year from renting out a spare room in her home on Airbnb. She must pay estimated tax on this income, as it is not subject to withholding. Finally, Michael, a self-employed consultant, earns $100,000 per year and must make estimated tax payments to avoid penalties and interest.\n\n3. NOTABLE EXAMPLES:\nSome well-known examples of estimated tax include the income earned by professional athletes and entertainers. For instance, a professional football player who earns $1 million per year in endorsement deals may be required to make estimated tax payments on this income. Similarly, a famous musician who earns $500,000 per year from royalties on their music may also be required to pay estimated tax. Another example is a bestselling author who earns $250,000 per year in book royalties and must make estimated tax payments to account for this income.\n\n4. EDGE CASES:\nIn some cases, estimated tax may be required in unexpected situations. For example, a person who wins a large sum of money in a lawsuit may be required to pay estimated tax on this income, even if it is a one-time payment. Another example is a person who inherits a large sum of money or property and must pay estimated tax on the income earned from these assets.\n\n5. NON-EXAMPLES:\nSome people may think that estimated tax applies to certain situations, but it does not. For example, employees who have taxes withheld from their paycheck by their employer do not need to make estimated tax payments, as their taxes are already being withheld. Another example is individuals who earn interest on a savings account or certificate of deposit, as this income is typically subject to withholding and does not require estimated tax payments. Finally, people who receive gifts or inheritances that are exempt from tax, such as gifts from family members or inheritances from a spouse, do not need to pay estimated tax on these amounts.\n\n6. PATTERN:\nAll valid examples of estimated tax have one thing in common: they involve income that is not subject to withholding. Whether it is self-employment income, investment income, or income from a side job, the key characteristic of estimated tax is that the income is not being withheld by an employer or other entity. As a result, the individual or business must take responsibility for making estimated tax payments to the government to avoid penalties and interest. By understanding this pattern, individuals and businesses can ensure that they are meeting their tax obligations and avoiding unnecessary penalties and interest.",
