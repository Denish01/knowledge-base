# Types of Power Of Attorney

1. INTRODUCTION:
Types of power of attorney refer to the different ways in which an individual can grant authority to another person or entity to act on their behalf in various matters, such as financial, medical, or personal decisions. Classification of power of attorney is crucial as it helps individuals understand the specific scope and limitations of the authority they are granting, ensuring that their interests are protected and their wishes are respected. By understanding the different types of power of attorney, individuals can make informed decisions about which type to use in different situations, and professionals, such as lawyers and financial advisors, can provide guidance and support to their clients.

2. MAIN CATEGORIES:
There are several main categories of power of attorney, each with its own unique characteristics and purposes. These include:
- **General Power of Attorney**: A general power of attorney grants broad authority to the agent to act on behalf of the principal in a wide range of matters, including financial, business, and personal decisions. Key characteristics include the agent's ability to act in all matters, except those specifically excluded by the principal. For example, a person may grant a general power of attorney to a trusted friend or family member to manage their financial affairs while they are away on an extended trip.
- **Special Power of Attorney**: A special power of attorney, also known as a limited power of attorney, grants authority to the agent to act on behalf of the principal in a specific matter or set of matters. Key characteristics include the agent's limited authority and the specific scope of the power granted. For example, a person may grant a special power of attorney to a real estate agent to sell their property.
- **Durable Power of Attorney**: A durable power of attorney remains in effect even if the principal becomes incapacitated or unable to make decisions. Key characteristics include the agent's continued authority to act on behalf of the principal, even in the event of incapacitation. For example, a person may grant a durable power of attorney to a trusted family member to manage their financial affairs in the event they become unable to do so themselves.
- **Springing Power of Attorney**: A springing power of attorney becomes effective only upon the occurrence of a specific event, such as the principal's incapacitation. Key characteristics include the agent's authority to act on behalf of the principal only after the specified event has occurred. For example, a person may grant a springing power of attorney to a trusted friend or family member to manage their financial affairs in the event they become incapacitated.
- **Medical Power of Attorney**: A medical power of attorney, also known as an advance directive, grants authority to the agent to make medical decisions on behalf of the principal. Key characteristics include the agent's authority to act in matters related to the principal's health and medical care. For example, a person may grant a medical power of attorney to a trusted family member to make medical decisions on their behalf if they become unable to do so themselves.
- **Financial Power of Attorney**: A financial power of attorney grants authority to the agent to manage the principal's financial affairs, including banking, investments, and tax matters. Key characteristics include the agent's authority to act in matters related to the principal's financial affairs. For example, a person may grant a financial power of attorney to a trusted friend or family member to manage their financial affairs while they are away on an extended trip.
