# What Assistance Programs Depends On

Eligibility determination is the most critical dependency for assistance programs, as it ensures that only qualified individuals receive benefits, and its absence led to a $2.2 billion overpayment in the US Supplemental Security Income program (Social Security Administration).

## Key Dependencies
- **Eligibility Determination** — is required to prevent overpayment and ensure that benefits are provided to those who need them, and without it, the US Supplemental Security Income program overpaid $2.2 billion to ineligible recipients (Social Security Administration). 
- **Income Verification** — is necessary to prevent fraud and ensure that benefits are not provided to those who do not need them, and its absence led to a 25% fraud rate in the California unemployment insurance program (California State Auditor).
- **Asset Assessment** — is needed to determine the level of assistance required, and without it, the US Department of Housing and Urban Development overpaid $1.4 billion in rental subsidies (US Department of Housing and Urban Development).
- **Program Guidelines** — are essential to ensure consistency in the application process, and their absence led to a 30% discrepancy in benefit levels in the US Medicaid program (US Government Accountability Office).
- **Recipient Monitoring** — is necessary to prevent abuse and ensure that benefits are used for their intended purpose, and its absence led to a $1.1 billion loss in the US Food Stamp Program (US Department of Agriculture).
- **Funding Allocation** — is required to ensure that sufficient resources are available to support the program, and without it, the US Head Start program was forced to reduce services to 60,000 children (US Department of Health and Human Services).

## Priority Order
The dependencies can be ranked in the following order from most to least critical:
- Eligibility determination is the most critical, as it prevents overpayment and ensures that benefits are provided to those who need them, with a potential loss of $2.2 billion if not implemented.
- Income verification is the second most critical, as it prevents fraud and ensures that benefits are not provided to those who do not need them, with a potential fraud rate of 25% if not implemented.
- Asset assessment is the third most critical, as it determines the level of assistance required, with a potential overpayment of $1.4 billion if not implemented.
- Program guidelines are the fourth most critical, as they ensure consistency in the application process, with a potential discrepancy of 30% in benefit levels if not implemented.
- Recipient monitoring is the fifth most critical, as it prevents abuse and ensures that benefits are used for their intended purpose, with a potential loss of $1.1 billion if not implemented.
- Funding allocation is the least critical, as it can be adjusted based on available resources, but still necessary to ensure that sufficient resources are available to support the program.

## Common Gaps
Many people overlook the importance of **Recipient Monitoring**, assuming that benefits will be used for their intended purpose, but this assumption can lead to a significant loss of funds, such as the $1.1 billion loss in the US Food Stamp Program. Another common gap is the assumption that **Program Guidelines** are not necessary, but this can lead to a discrepancy in benefit levels, such as the 30% discrepancy in the US Medicaid program.
