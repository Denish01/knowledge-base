# Assistance Programs Compared

## Definition
Assistance programs compared refers to the evaluation and analysis of different types of assistance programs, such as **food stamps** and **Medicaid**, which were first introduced in the United States in 1964 as part of President Lyndon B. Johnson's **Great Society** initiative.

## How It Works
Assistance programs are designed to provide support to low-income individuals and families, and they are typically funded by the government. The **Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)**, for example, provides an average of $129 per month to eligible individuals (USDA), which can be used to purchase food at participating retailers. The program uses a **means-tested** approach, where eligibility is determined based on income and family size. In 2020, SNAP helped over 37 million people in the United States, with a total budget of $60 billion (USDA).

The **Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)** program, on the other hand, provides block grants to states to support low-income families with children. The program has a **work requirement**, which means that recipients must be working or participating in job training activities to receive benefits. In 2020, TANF served over 1.5 million families, with a total budget of $17 billion (HHS). Ricardo's **comparative advantage model** (1817) can be applied to assistance programs, where countries or states specialize in providing different types of support to maximize efficiency.

Assistance programs also use **targeting** mechanisms to ensure that benefits are directed to those who need them most. For example, the **Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)** provides a refundable tax credit to low-income working individuals, which can be worth up to $6,728 per year (IRS). The program uses a **phase-out** mechanism, where the credit amount decreases as income increases, to target benefits to those who need them most. In 2020, the EITC lifted over 5 million people out of poverty, with a total budget of $63 billion (IRS).

## Key Components
- **Eligibility criteria**: determine who is eligible to receive benefits, such as income level, family size, and work status, and changes in these criteria can affect the number of people served and the program's budget.
- **Benefit levels**: determine the amount of support provided to eligible individuals, such as the amount of food stamps or cash assistance, and changes in these levels can affect the program's effectiveness in reducing poverty.
- **Funding mechanisms**: determine how programs are funded, such as through government appropriations or private donations, and changes in these mechanisms can affect the program's budget and scope.
- **Administrative structures**: determine how programs are implemented and managed, such as through state or local agencies, and changes in these structures can affect the program's efficiency and effectiveness.
- **Evaluation metrics**: determine how programs are evaluated, such as through measures of poverty reduction or employment rates, and changes in these metrics can affect the program's funding and scope.
- **Partnerships and collaborations**: determine how programs work with other organizations, such as non-profits or private companies, and changes in these partnerships can affect the program's reach and effectiveness.

## Common Misconceptions
**Myth:** Assistance programs are only used by people who are lazy or unwilling to work — **Fact:** The majority of SNAP recipients are working individuals who are struggling to make ends meet, with over 70% of recipients having at least one working adult in the household (USDA).
**Myth:** Assistance programs are too expensive and wasteful — **Fact:** SNAP has a **fraud rate** of less than 1%, and the program has a **return on investment** of $1.70 in economic activity for every dollar spent (USDA).
**Myth:** Assistance programs create **dependency** and discourage work — **Fact:** The EITC has been shown to **increase labor market participation** among low-income individuals, with a study by the **National Bureau of Economic Research** finding that the credit increases employment rates by 10% (NBER).
**Myth:** Assistance programs are only used by people who are not citizens — **Fact:** The majority of assistance program recipients are **US citizens**, with over 90% of SNAP recipients being citizens (USDA).

## In Practice
The state of **California** has implemented a number of innovative assistance programs, including the **CalFresh** program, which provides food assistance to over 2 million people in the state (CDSS). The program uses a **simplified application process** and **online enrollment** to make it easier for people to access benefits. In 2020, the program had a budget of $3.5 billion and helped to reduce the state's **food insecurity rate** by 10% (CDSS). The program also partners with **non-profit organizations**, such as the **California Food Bank**, to provide additional support to low-income individuals and families.
