# What is What Support Adjustment Depends On?

1. INTRODUCTION:
Support adjustment refers to the process of modifying or changing the level of support provided to an individual, group, or system. This can include adjusting the type, frequency, or intensity of support to better meet the needs of the recipient. Understanding the dependencies of support adjustment is crucial, as it helps to ensure that the support provided is effective and sustainable. The dependencies of support adjustment are the foundation upon which successful support is built, and neglecting them can lead to inadequate or ineffective support.

2. KEY DEPENDENCIES:
The following are key dependencies that support adjustment relies on:
- Clear Communication: Support adjustment requires clear and effective communication between the supporter and the recipient. This is necessary to understand the recipient's needs and to make informed decisions about the type and level of support to provide. Without clear communication, support may be misdirected or ineffective, leading to frustration and dissatisfaction.
- Defined Goals and Objectives: Support adjustment depends on well-defined goals and objectives. This is necessary to provide a clear direction for the support and to measure its effectiveness. Without defined goals and objectives, support may lack focus and direction, leading to confusion and inefficiency.
- Available Resources: Support adjustment relies on the availability of sufficient resources, including time, money, and personnel. This is necessary to provide the necessary level and type of support. Without available resources, support may be inadequate or unsustainable, leading to burnout and disappointment.
- Ongoing Assessment and Evaluation: Support adjustment requires ongoing assessment and evaluation to determine its effectiveness and identify areas for improvement. This is necessary to make informed decisions about the support and to ensure that it remains relevant and effective. Without ongoing assessment and evaluation, support may become stagnant and ineffective, leading to decreased satisfaction and outcomes.
- Recipient Engagement and Participation: Support adjustment depends on the active engagement and participation of the recipient. This is necessary to ensure that the support is tailored to the recipient's needs and to promote a sense of ownership and responsibility. Without recipient engagement and participation, support may be imposed or irrelevant, leading to resistance and decreased effectiveness.
- Flexibility and Adaptability: Support adjustment requires flexibility and adaptability to respond to changing circumstances and needs. This is necessary to ensure that the support remains relevant and effective over time. Without flexibility and adaptability, support may become rigid and inflexible, leading to decreased effectiveness and satisfaction.

3. ORDER OF IMPORTANCE:
While all the dependencies are crucial, clear communication and defined goals and objectives are the most critical. These two dependencies provide the foundation for effective support adjustment, as they enable the supporter to understand the recipient's needs and to provide targeted and effective support. The other dependencies, while important, build upon this foundation and are essential for sustaining and improving the support over time.

4. COMMON GAPS:
One common gap in support adjustment is the assumption that the recipient's needs are static and unchanging. This can lead to a lack of ongoing assessment and evaluation, resulting in support that becomes outdated and ineffective. Another common gap is the failure to engage the recipient in the support adjustment process, leading to a lack of ownership and participation. These gaps can be addressed by prioritizing clear communication, defined goals and objectives, and recipient engagement and participation.

5. SUMMARY:
In summary, support adjustment depends on a range of key dependencies, including clear communication, defined goals and objectives, available resources, ongoing assessment and evaluation, recipient engagement and participation, and flexibility and adaptability. By understanding and addressing these dependencies, supporters can provide effective and sustainable support that meets the needs of the recipient. The foundation for successful support adjustment is built upon clear communication, defined goals and objectives, and recipient engagement and participation, and it is essential to prioritize these dependencies to ensure that the support remains relevant, effective, and sustainable over time.
