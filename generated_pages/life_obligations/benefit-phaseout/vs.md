# Benefit Phaseout Compared

## Definition
Benefit phaseout compared is a fiscal policy concept that refers to the gradual reduction of government benefits as a recipient's income increases, originating from the work of economist Milton Friedman in 1962.

## How It Works
The benefit phaseout mechanism is designed to target government support towards those who need it most, while minimizing the disincentive to work. As an individual's income rises, their eligibility for benefits decreases, typically at a predetermined rate. For instance, the **Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)** in the United States phases out at a rate of 21% for single filers with two or more children, resulting in a maximum credit reduction of $5,656 (Internal Revenue Service). This phaseout rate is critical in determining the effectiveness of the benefit in encouraging work and reducing poverty. Ricardo's comparative advantage model, 1817, also informs the design of benefit phaseout systems, as it highlights the importance of allocating resources to their most valuable uses.

The phaseout rate and income threshold are crucial parameters in benefit phaseout design. A higher phaseout rate can lead to a more significant reduction in benefits, potentially creating a disincentive to work, as seen in the **Notch Problem** identified by economist Jerry Green in 1980. On the other hand, a lower phaseout rate may result in a more gradual reduction in benefits, but at the cost of increased government expenditure. The **Marginal Tax Rate (MTR)**, which combines the phaseout rate with the income tax rate, is a key determinant of the overall effectiveness of the benefit phaseout system. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the MTR for low-income households in the United States can exceed 50% due to the interaction of multiple benefit phaseouts.

The interaction between multiple benefit phaseouts can lead to complex and unpredictable outcomes. For example, the **Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)** and **Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)** in the United States both have their own phaseout rates and income thresholds, resulting in a **Benefit Cliff** that can create significant disincentives to work. Research by the Urban Institute has shown that the cumulative effect of these phaseouts can lead to MTRs exceeding 100% for some households, effectively creating a **Poverty Trap**.

## Key Components
- **Phaseout Rate**: determines the rate at which benefits are reduced as income increases, with higher rates leading to more rapid benefit reduction
- **Income Threshold**: sets the level of income above which benefits begin to phase out, with higher thresholds resulting in more individuals being eligible for benefits
- **Benefit Cliff**: occurs when multiple benefit phaseouts interact to create a sudden and significant reduction in benefits, potentially creating a disincentive to work
- **Marginal Tax Rate (MTR)**: combines the phaseout rate with the income tax rate to determine the overall tax burden on low-income households
- **Notch Problem**: arises when the phaseout rate creates a disincentive to work, as individuals may prefer to remain at a lower income level to maintain eligibility for benefits
- **Poverty Trap**: occurs when the cumulative effect of multiple benefit phaseouts creates a situation in which it is more beneficial for an individual to remain in poverty rather than seeking employment

## Common Misconceptions
**Myth:** Benefit phaseout is a simple and straightforward concept — **Fact:** The interaction between multiple phaseouts can lead to complex and unpredictable outcomes, as seen in the **Benefit Cliff** phenomenon. 
**Myth:** A higher phaseout rate is always more effective in reducing government expenditure — **Fact:** A higher phaseout rate can create a disincentive to work, as seen in the **Notch Problem**, and may ultimately lead to increased poverty and government expenditure. 
**Myth:** Benefit phaseout only applies to means-tested programs — **Fact:** Benefit phaseout can apply to a wide range of government programs, including tax credits and social insurance programs, such as the **EITC** and **Social Security**. 
**Myth:** The phaseout rate is the only critical parameter in benefit phaseout design — **Fact:** The income threshold, MTR, and interaction between multiple phaseouts are also crucial determinants of the effectiveness of the benefit phaseout system.

## In Practice
The **Australian Government's Newstart Allowance** provides a concrete example of benefit phaseout in practice. The allowance phases out at a rate of 50 cents per dollar earned above the income threshold of AUD 102 per fortnight, resulting in a maximum reduction of AUD 624 per fortnight (Australian Government Department of Human Services). This phaseout rate is designed to encourage work and reduce poverty, while minimizing the disincentive to seek employment. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the Newstart Allowance has been effective in reducing poverty and increasing labor market participation among low-income households, with the **poverty rate** decreasing by 2.5 percentage points between 2013 and 2019 (Australian Bureau of Statistics).
