# How Non Compete Agreement Works

1. QUICK ANSWER: A non-compete agreement is a contract between an employer and an employee that restricts the employee from working for a competitor or starting a similar business after leaving the company. This agreement is designed to protect the employer's trade secrets, business practices, and customer relationships by limiting the employee's ability to use the knowledge and expertise gained while working for the company in a competing venture.

2. STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS: 
First, an employer creates a non-compete agreement and presents it to the employee, usually as a condition of employment. 
Then, the employee signs the agreement, indicating their understanding of the terms and restrictions. 
Next, the agreement outlines the specific restrictions, including the geographic area, time period, and type of business or activities that are off-limits. 
After that, if the employee leaves the company, they are bound by the terms of the agreement and must refrain from engaging in any restricted activities. 
Finally, if the employee violates the agreement, the employer can take legal action to enforce the terms and seek damages or an injunction to prevent further competition.

3. KEY COMPONENTS: 
The key components of a non-compete agreement include the employer, the employee, the restricted activities, the geographic area, and the time period. The employer is the party that creates the agreement and seeks to protect its business interests. The employee is the party that signs the agreement and is bound by its terms. The restricted activities are the specific business practices or types of employment that the employee is prohibited from engaging in. The geographic area defines the region where the restrictions apply, and the time period specifies the duration of the agreement.

4. VISUAL ANALOGY: A non-compete agreement can be thought of as a fence around a garden. Just as a fence prevents people from entering the garden and accessing the plants and flowers, a non-compete agreement prevents an employee from entering a competing business and using their knowledge and expertise to harm their former employer's interests. The fence (agreement) is designed to protect the garden (business) and its contents (trade secrets and customer relationships).

5. COMMON QUESTIONS: 
But what about if the employee is fired or laid off - are they still bound by the agreement? 
What happens if the employee moves to a different state or country - does the agreement still apply? 
Can an employee negotiate the terms of the non-compete agreement, or is it a standard contract? 
What are the consequences if an employee violates the agreement - can they be sued or fined?

6. SUMMARY: A non-compete agreement is a contractual mechanism that restricts an employee's ability to work for a competitor or start a similar business after leaving a company, by outlining specific terms and restrictions that the employee must follow in order to protect the employer's trade secrets, business practices, and customer relationships.
