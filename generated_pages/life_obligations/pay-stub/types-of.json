Understanding the different types of pay stubs is essential for employees to manage their finances, and for employers to maintain accurate payroll records. Classification of pay stubs matters because it helps to organize and differentiate between various pay periods, payment methods, and employee types. This classification system enables individuals to identify and understand the specific characteristics of each pay stub, ensuring accurate record-keeping and compliance with labor laws.\n\n## MAIN CATEGORIES\nThe following are the main categories of pay stubs:\n1. **Gross Pay Stub**\n   - Definition: A gross pay stub shows the total amount of money earned by an employee before any deductions or taxes are made. It provides a detailed breakdown of the employee's earnings, including regular pay, overtime, and any additional forms of compensation.\n   - Key characteristics: Includes gross pay, earnings, and pay rate.\n   - Example: An employee earns a gross pay of $1,000 per week, with $800 in regular pay and $200 in overtime pay.\n2. **Net Pay Stub**\n   - Definition: A net pay stub displays the amount of money an employee takes home after all deductions and taxes have been made. It provides a clear picture of the employee's take-home pay, which can be used for budgeting and financial planning.\n   - Key characteristics: Includes net pay, deductions, and taxes.\n   - Example: An employee's net pay is $700 per week, after $300 in deductions and taxes are subtracted from their gross pay.\n3. **Accrual Pay Stub**\n   - Definition: An accrual pay stub shows the amount of money an employee has earned but has not yet received. This type of pay stub is used to track accrued time off, such as vacation or sick leave.\n   - Key characteristics: Includes accrued time off, pay rate, and accrual period.\n   - Example: An employee accrues 10 hours of vacation time per month, which is reflected on their pay stub as accrued time off.\n4. **Termination Pay Stub**\n   - Definition: A termination pay stub is provided to an employee when their employment is terminated, and it includes any final payments, such as accrued vacation time or severance pay. This type of pay stub is used to ensure that the employee receives all owed compensation.\n   - Key characteristics: Includes final payment, accrued time off, and severance pay.\n   - Example: An employee receives a termination pay stub with a final payment of $5,000, which includes $2,000 in accrued vacation time and $3,000 in severance pay.\n5. **Corrected Pay Stub**\n   - Definition: A corrected pay stub is issued when there is an error on a previous pay stub, such as an incorrect deduction or tax amount. This type of pay stub is used to correct any mistakes and ensure that the employee's pay is accurate.\n   - Key characteristics: Includes corrected pay, deductions, and taxes.\n   - Example: An employee receives a corrected pay stub with a revised net pay of $750, after an error in deductions was corrected.\n\n## COMPARISON TABLE\nThe following table summarizes the differences between the main categories of pay stubs:\n| Type of Pay Stub | Description | Key Characteristics | Example |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Gross Pay Stub | Shows total earnings before deductions | Gross pay, earnings, pay rate | $1,000 per week |\n| Net Pay Stub | Displays take-home pay after deductions | Net pay, deductions, taxes | $700 per week |\n| Accrual Pay Stub | Shows accrued time off | Accrued time off, pay rate, accrual period | 10 hours per month |\n| Termination Pay Stub | Includes final payments and accrued time off | Final payment, accrued time off, severance pay | $5,000 |\n| Corrected Pay Stub | Corrects errors on previous pay stubs | Corrected pay, deductions, taxes | $750 per week |\n\n## HOW THEY RELATE\nThe different types of pay stubs are connected in that they all provide information about an employee's pay and benefits. The gross pay stub serves as the foundation, as it shows the total amount of money earned by the employee. The net pay stub is then derived from the gross pay stub, after deductions and taxes are made. The accrual pay stub is related to the gross pay stub, as it shows the amount of time off accrued by the employee. The termination pay stub is a specialized type of pay stub that is used when an employee's employment is terminated. The corrected pay stub is used to correct any errors on previous pay stubs, ensuring that the employee's pay is accurate.\n\n## SUMMARY\nThe classification system for pay stubs includes five main categories: gross pay stub, net pay stub, accrual pay stub, termination pay stub, and corrected pay stub, each with distinct characteristics and purposes that connect and differ from one another to provide a comprehensive understanding of an employee's pay and benefits.",
