The goal of rehabilitative support is to help individuals achieve their maximum level of independence and quality of life, and to enable them to participate fully in their daily activities and community. This process can take place in a variety of settings, including hospitals, rehabilitation centers, and community-based programs.\n\nRehabilitative support involves a holistic approach, addressing the physical, emotional, and social aspects of an individual's life. It includes a range of interventions, such as physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and counseling, which are tailored to the individual's specific needs and goals.
