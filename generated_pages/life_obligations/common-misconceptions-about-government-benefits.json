In reality, the goal of these benefits is to provide support, allowing individuals to maintain their independence as much as possible.\n\n- **Myth:** You can only receive one type of government benefit at a time.\n  **Reality:** Depending on the specific benefits and circumstances, it is possible to receive multiple government benefits simultaneously.\n  **Why people believe this:** The assumption that government benefits are mutually exclusive can lead to this misconception.
