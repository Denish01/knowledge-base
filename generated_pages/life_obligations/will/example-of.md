# Example of Will

1. INTRODUCTION
Will refers to the firm intention or determination to do something. It is the resolve or commitment to achieve a goal or complete a task, often in the face of obstacles or challenges. Understanding will is essential in various aspects of life, as it drives individuals to strive for excellence and persevere through difficulties.

2. EVERYDAY EXAMPLES
In daily life, examples of will can be seen in various situations. For instance, a student named Alex decides to wake up every morning at 6:00 AM to study for a crucial exam, determined to score high grades. Another example is a working mother, Sarah, who commutes two hours every day to provide for her family, demonstrating her will to ensure their well-being. Additionally, a person named Jack, who has been struggling with a sedentary lifestyle, resolves to exercise for 30 minutes every day to improve his health. These individuals exhibit will by setting goals and working towards achieving them despite the challenges they may face.

Furthermore, consider the example of a small business owner, Emily, who invests 12 hours a day, 6 days a week, to build her company from scratch. Her determination to succeed drives her to overcome the numerous obstacles that come with entrepreneurship. These everyday examples illustrate how will is an essential component of achieving success in various aspects of life.

3. NOTABLE EXAMPLES
There are also notable examples of will that have been documented throughout history. For instance, Thomas Edison, the inventor of the light bulb, is known to have failed over 1,000 times before finally succeeding. His unwavering determination to create a working light bulb is a classic example of will. Another example is the story of J.K. Rowling, who wrote much of the first Harry Potter book in local cafes, as she did not have a computer or a quiet place to work at home. Her will to become a published author drove her to continue writing despite the difficulties she faced.

The story of Stephen Hawking, who was diagnosed with a motor neuron disease at the age of 21, is also a remarkable example of will. Despite being given only a few years to live, Hawking defied the odds and lived for more than 50 years, becoming one of the most renowned physicists of his time. His determination to continue working and contributing to the field of physics, even in the face of a debilitating illness, is a testament to the power of will.

4. EDGE CASES
There are also unusual examples of will that may not be immediately apparent. For instance, a person named Michael, who has a severe fear of public speaking, resolves to give a presentation in front of a large audience. Despite his fear, Michael prepares meticulously and delivers a successful presentation, demonstrating his will to overcome his phobia. This example illustrates how will can be applied to overcome internal obstacles, such as fears and anxieties, in addition to external challenges.

5. NON-EXAMPLES
It is essential to distinguish between will and other concepts that may seem similar but are not. For example, desire is not the same as will. A person may desire to be wealthy, but if they do not take any action to achieve their goal, they do not exhibit will. Another non-example is wishful thinking, where an individual may wish for something to happen without putting in any effort to make it a reality. Additionally, impulsive behavior, such as acting on a whim without considering the consequences, is not an example of will, as it lacks the deliberation and commitment that characterizes true will.

6. PATTERN
Despite the diversity of examples, all instances of will share a common pattern. They involve a clear intention or goal, a commitment to achieving that goal, and the perseverance to overcome obstacles and challenges. Whether it is a student studying for an exam, an entrepreneur building a business, or an individual overcoming a personal fear, the underlying factor that drives success is the firm intention and determination to achieve a goal. This pattern highlights the importance of will in achieving success and overcoming adversity in various aspects of life.
