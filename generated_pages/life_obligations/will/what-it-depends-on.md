# What is What Will Depends On?

1. INTRODUCTION:
The concept of will refers to the ability to make decisions, act upon them, and shape one's own destiny. Understanding what will depends on is essential because it highlights the prerequisites, requirements, and foundations necessary for an individual to exercise their will effectively. Recognizing these dependencies is crucial as it allows individuals to identify areas where they may need to focus their efforts in order to strengthen their will.

2. KEY DEPENDENCIES:
- **Self-awareness**: Will depends on self-awareness, which is the ability to have a clear understanding of one's own thoughts, feelings, and motivations. This is necessary because self-awareness enables individuals to make informed decisions that align with their values and goals. Without self-awareness, individuals may struggle to make decisions that are in their best interests, leading to confusion and uncertainty.
- **Motivation**: Will also depends on motivation, which is the driving force behind an individual's actions. Motivation is necessary because it provides the energy and direction needed to pursue goals and overcome obstacles. Without motivation, individuals may lack the enthusiasm and persistence required to achieve their objectives.
- **Knowledge and understanding**: Another key dependency of will is knowledge and understanding, which refers to the acquisition of information and insights necessary for making informed decisions. This is necessary because knowledge and understanding enable individuals to evaluate options, anticipate consequences, and make wise choices. Without knowledge and understanding, individuals may make decisions that are not in their best interests.
- **Emotional regulation**: Will depends on emotional regulation, which is the ability to manage one's emotions in a way that supports decision-making and action. Emotional regulation is necessary because it enables individuals to remain calm and focused, even in the face of challenges and setbacks. Without emotional regulation, individuals may be controlled by their emotions, leading to impulsive decisions and actions.
- **Supportive environment**: Finally, will depends on a supportive environment, which refers to the presence of people, resources, and circumstances that facilitate an individual's ability to exercise their will. A supportive environment is necessary because it provides individuals with the encouragement, guidance, and resources needed to pursue their goals and overcome obstacles. Without a supportive environment, individuals may face significant challenges and barriers that hinder their progress.

3. ORDER OF IMPORTANCE:
While all of these dependencies are crucial, self-awareness and motivation are perhaps the most critical. Without a clear understanding of oneself and a driving force to pursue one's goals, it is difficult to exercise will effectively. Knowledge and understanding, emotional regulation, and a supportive environment are also essential, but they build upon the foundation established by self-awareness and motivation.

4. COMMON GAPS:
One common gap that people often overlook is the importance of emotional regulation in exercising will. Many individuals assume that they can simply "tough it out" or "push through" challenges, without recognizing the need to manage their emotions in a way that supports their decision-making and actions. Another common gap is the assumption that a supportive environment will automatically be present, without taking steps to cultivate and maintain it.

5. SUMMARY:
In summary, the ability to exercise will depends on a range of key dependencies, including self-awareness, motivation, knowledge and understanding, emotional regulation, and a supportive environment. By recognizing and addressing these dependencies, individuals can establish a strong foundation for exercising their will and achieving their goals. Ultimately, understanding what will depends on is essential for making informed decisions, taking deliberate actions, and shaping one's own destiny.
