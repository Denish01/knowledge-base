# What is Types Of Child Support?

INTRODUCTION
The types of child support refer to the various ways in which financial assistance is provided to children whose parents are separated, divorced, or never married. Classification of child support is essential as it helps individuals understand their obligations and entitlements, and facilitates the development of effective support arrangements that cater to the unique needs of each family. By categorizing child support into different types, parents, caregivers, and legal professionals can better navigate the complexities of child support and ensure that children receive the financial care they deserve.

MAIN CATEGORIES
1. **Temporary Child Support**
   - Definition: Temporary child support is a type of support provided during a transitional period, such as while a divorce or separation is being finalized. It is intended to address the immediate financial needs of the child.
   - Key characteristics: Temporary, often court-ordered, and based on interim financial arrangements.
   - Example: A mother may receive temporary child support from the father while their divorce is being processed, to cover the child's living expenses.

2. **Permanent Child Support**
   - Definition: Permanent child support is a long-term arrangement that provides financial assistance to the child until they reach adulthood or become self-sufficient. It is based on the financial circumstances of both parents and the needs of the child.
   - Key characteristics: Long-term, court-ordered, and subject to periodic review and adjustment.
   - Example: A father may be required to pay permanent child support to the mother, which is adjusted annually based on changes in his income and the child's needs.

3. **Rehabilitative Child Support**
   - Definition: Rehabilitative child support is a type of support provided to enable a parent to become self-sufficient and improve their financial situation, thereby enhancing their ability to support the child.
   - Key characteristics: Temporary, focused on parental rehabilitation, and often tied to specific goals such as education or job training.
   - Example: A mother may receive rehabilitative child support to pursue vocational training, which will increase her earning potential and enable her to support the child in the long term.

4. **Pendente Lite Child Support**
   - Definition: Pendente lite child support is a type of temporary support provided while a legal action, such as a divorce or custody dispute, is pending. It is intended to maintain the status quo and ensure the child's needs are met during the litigation process.
   - Key characteristics: Temporary, often court-ordered, and based on the financial circumstances of both parties.
   - Example: A father may be required to pay pendente lite child support to the mother while their custody dispute is being resolved, to cover the child's living expenses.

5. **Arrearage Child Support**
   - Definition: Arrearage child support refers to the accumulation of unpaid child support obligations, which can accrue interest and penalties.
   - Key characteristics: Past-due support, often subject to interest and penalties, and may be collected through various enforcement mechanisms.
   - Example: A father who fails to pay child support for several months may accumulate an arrearage, which he will be required to pay in addition to his ongoing support obligations.
