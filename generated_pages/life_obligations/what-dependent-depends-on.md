# What is What Dependent Depends On?

1. INTRODUCTION
A dependent is someone or something that relies on another person, thing, or circumstance for support, existence, or functionality. Understanding dependencies is crucial because it helps identify the prerequisites, requirements, and foundations necessary for something to exist, function, or succeed. In the context of a dependent, recognizing these dependencies is essential to provide the necessary support and ensure their well-being.

2. KEY DEPENDENCIES
Several key dependencies are essential for a dependent to thrive. These include:
- Financial Support: This is necessary to provide the dependent with basic necessities like food, shelter, and clothing. Without financial support, the dependent may struggle to survive, leading to poverty, hunger, and poor living conditions.
- Emotional Care: Emotional care is vital for a dependent's mental and emotional well-being. It involves providing love, comfort, and a sense of security. Without emotional care, the dependent may experience anxiety, depression, or low self-esteem.
- Physical Care: Physical care is essential for a dependent's health and physical well-being. This includes providing medical care, nutrition, and hygiene. Without physical care, the dependent may suffer from poor health, illness, or injury.
- Social Interaction: Social interaction is necessary for a dependent's social and emotional development. It involves providing opportunities for socialization, communication, and relationship-building. Without social interaction, the dependent may experience isolation, loneliness, or difficulty forming relationships.
- Education and Training: Education and training are vital for a dependent's personal and professional growth. They involve providing access to knowledge, skills, and resources necessary for independence and self-sufficiency. Without education and training, the dependent may struggle to achieve their goals or become self-sufficient.

3. ORDER OF IMPORTANCE
While all dependencies are crucial, some are more critical than others. Financial support and physical care are often the most immediate and essential dependencies, as they provide the basic necessities for survival. Emotional care and social interaction are also vital, as they support the dependent's mental and emotional well-being. Education and training, while important for long-term growth and development, may be considered slightly less urgent but still essential for the dependent's future success.

4. COMMON GAPS
People often overlook or assume that a dependent has access to certain dependencies, such as social interaction or education and training. However, these dependencies may not always be available or accessible, particularly for dependents with disabilities or those living in disadvantaged circumstances. Additionally, people may assume that financial support is the only essential dependency, neglecting the importance of emotional care, physical care, and social interaction.

5. SUMMARY
In conclusion, a dependent relies on several key dependencies to thrive, including financial support, emotional care, physical care, social interaction, and education and training. Understanding these dependencies and their importance is essential to provide the necessary support and ensure the dependent's well-being. By recognizing the prerequisites, requirements, and foundations necessary for a dependent to exist, function, or succeed, we can better provide for their needs and help them achieve their full potential. A solid foundation of these dependencies is crucial for a dependent's overall health, happiness, and success.
