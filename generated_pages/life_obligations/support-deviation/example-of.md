# What is Examples Of Support Deviation?

1. INTRODUCTION:
Support deviation refers to the difference between the expected and actual performance or behavior of a system, process, or individual. It can occur in various contexts, including engineering, finance, education, and more. Understanding support deviation is crucial for identifying areas of improvement, optimizing performance, and making informed decisions.

2. EVERYDAY EXAMPLES:
In daily life, support deviation can be observed in many situations. For instance, a student who is expected to score 80% on a math test but scores 60% instead is an example of support deviation. Another example is a car that is expected to achieve a fuel efficiency of 30 miles per gallon but only achieves 25 miles per gallon. A company that expects to sell 100 units of a product per month but only sells 80 units is also an example of support deviation. Additionally, a person who expects to finish a project in 5 days but takes 7 days to complete it is another example of support deviation.

3. NOTABLE EXAMPLES:
There are several well-known examples of support deviation. The Titanic, for example, was expected to be unsinkable, but it sank on its maiden voyage, resulting in a significant support deviation. The Space Shuttle Challenger disaster is another example, where the expected performance of the O-rings was not met, leading to a catastrophic failure. The Enron scandal is also an example of support deviation, where the company's expected financial performance was not met, resulting in a major accounting scandal.

4. EDGE CASES:
Some unusual examples of support deviation include the case of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge, which was expected to withstand strong winds but collapsed due to aeroelastic flutter. Another example is the case of the Therac-25 radiation therapy machine, which was expected to deliver precise doses of radiation but malfunctioned due to a software bug, resulting in support deviation.

5. NON-EXAMPLES:
There are several things that people often confuse with support deviation but are not. For example, a change in expectations or goals is not support deviation. If a company decides to reduce its sales target from 100 units to 80 units, it is not an example of support deviation. Similarly, a one-time anomaly or outlier is not support deviation. If a student scores 90% on a test but normally scores 70%, it is not an example of support deviation. Additionally, a lack of data or information is not support deviation. If a company does not have enough data to determine its sales performance, it is not an example of support deviation.

6. PATTERN:
All valid examples of support deviation have one thing in common: a difference between expected and actual performance or behavior. This difference can be measured in terms of quantity, quality, or time, and it can occur in various contexts and scales. Whether it is a student's test score, a car's fuel efficiency, or a company's sales performance, support deviation occurs when the actual performance or behavior deviates from the expected performance or behavior. By recognizing and analyzing support deviation, individuals and organizations can identify areas for improvement, optimize performance, and make informed decisions.
