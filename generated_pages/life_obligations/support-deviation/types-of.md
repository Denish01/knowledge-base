# What is Types Of Support Deviation?

## INTRODUCTION
Types of support deviation refer to the various ways in which a structure or system can deviate from its intended or original design, often due to external or internal factors. This classification is crucial in understanding and addressing the issues that arise from such deviations, as it helps identify the root cause and informs the necessary corrective actions. By categorizing support deviations, engineers, architects, and other professionals can better analyze and mitigate the effects of these deviations, ensuring the stability, safety, and functionality of the structure or system.

## MAIN CATEGORIES
The following are the primary types of support deviation:
1. **Settlement Deviation**
   - Definition: Settlement deviation occurs when a structure sinks or settles into the ground, often due to soil compaction or other geological factors. This can lead to unevenness and instability in the structure.
   - Key Characteristics: Gradual or sudden sinking, soil compaction, and changes in the structure's foundation.
   - Example: A building settling into the ground due to poor soil preparation, leading to uneven floors and walls.
2. **Lateral Deviation**
   - Definition: Lateral deviation refers to the movement of a structure sideways, often due to wind, seismic activity, or other external forces. This type of deviation can cause significant stress on the structure's foundations and walls.
   - Key Characteristics: Sideways movement, external forces, and stress on the structure's foundations and walls.
   - Example: A skyscraper swaying in strong winds, resulting in potential damage to its foundations and adjacent structures.
3. **Tilt Deviation**
   - Definition: Tilt deviation occurs when a structure leans or tilts to one side, often due to uneven settlement or external forces. This can lead to issues with the structure's balance and stability.
   - Key Characteristics: Uneven settlement, external forces, and imbalance in the structure.
   - Example: A tower leaning due to uneven soil settlement, posing a risk to its stability and surrounding structures.
4. **Rotation Deviation**
   - Definition: Rotation deviation refers to the rotation of a structure around a fixed point, often due to external forces or uneven settlement. This can cause significant stress on the structure's foundations and connections.
   - Key Characteristics: Rotation around a fixed point, external forces, and stress on the structure's connections.
   - Example: A bridge rotating slightly due to seismic activity, affecting its alignment and structural integrity.

## COMPARISON TABLE
| Type of Deviation | Definition | Key Characteristics | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Settlement Deviation | Sinking or settling into the ground | Gradual or sudden sinking, soil compaction | Building settling into the ground |
| Lateral Deviation | Sideways movement | External forces, stress on foundations and walls | Skyscraper swaying in strong winds |
| Tilt Deviation | Leaning or tilting to one side | Uneven settlement, external forces, imbalance | Tower leaning due to uneven soil settlement |
| Rotation Deviation | Rotation around a fixed point | Rotation, external forces, stress on connections | Bridge rotating due to seismic activity |

## HOW THEY RELATE
The different types of support deviation are interconnected and can often occur simultaneously or in sequence. For instance, settlement deviation can lead to tilt deviation, while lateral deviation can cause rotation deviation. Understanding these relationships is essential in identifying the root cause of a deviation and developing effective corrective measures. Each type of deviation requires a unique approach to analysis and mitigation, and recognizing their connections can help professionals develop comprehensive solutions.

## SUMMARY
The classification system for types of support deviation encompasses settlement, lateral, tilt, and rotation deviations, each with distinct characteristics and examples, providing a framework for understanding and addressing the various ways in which structures can deviate from their intended design.
