# Example of Benefit Estimation

## Definition
Benefit estimation is a quantitative method used to assess the potential benefits of a project or investment, often employed in **cost-benefit analysis** to determine the viability of a proposed initiative, as described by Alfred Marshall in his work on economics (Marshall, 1890).

## How It Works
Benefit estimation involves identifying and quantifying the potential benefits of a project, such as increased revenue, cost savings, or improved efficiency, using techniques like **discounted cash flow analysis**. This process requires establishing a baseline scenario, against which the benefits of the proposed project are measured, allowing for a comparison of the potential outcomes with and without the project. For instance, a company like Boeing produces ~800 aircraft annually (Boeing annual report), and estimating the benefits of investing in new manufacturing technology would involve calculating the potential increase in production capacity and resulting revenue.

The estimation of benefits is often based on historical data, industry trends, and market research, as well as **sensitivity analysis** to account for potential risks and uncertainties. The use of **Ricardo's comparative advantage model** (Ricardo, 1817) can also inform benefit estimation by identifying areas where a project or investment can create value by exploiting comparative advantages. Additionally, benefit estimation may involve assessing the potential **externalities**, such as environmental impacts or social benefits, that can affect the overall value of a project.

The accuracy of benefit estimation depends on the quality of the data used and the assumptions made, as well as the ability to account for potential **opportunity costs**. A well-conducted benefit estimation can provide a clear understanding of the potential benefits of a project and inform decision-making, as seen in the example of the **European Union's cost-benefit analysis** of its investment in renewable energy infrastructure, which has led to a significant increase in the use of solar and wind power (European Commission).

## Key Components
- **Discount rate**: The rate at which future benefits are discounted to their present value, affecting the estimated benefit of a project, with a higher discount rate reducing the present value of future benefits.
- **Benefit streams**: The series of benefits expected to arise from a project, such as increased revenue or cost savings, which can be affected by factors like market trends and competition.
- **Baseline scenario**: The scenario against which the benefits of a project are measured, establishing a reference point for comparison, and allowing for the identification of the incremental benefits of the project.
- **Sensitivity analysis**: The analysis of how changes in assumptions or variables affect the estimated benefits of a project, helping to identify potential risks and uncertainties.
- **Externalities**: The external effects of a project, such as environmental impacts or social benefits, which can affect the overall value of a project and should be accounted for in benefit estimation.
- **Opportunity costs**: The benefits that could have been realized if a different project or investment had been chosen, which should be considered in benefit estimation to ensure that the selected project is the most valuable option.

## Common Misconceptions
- **Myth:** Benefit estimation is only relevant for large-scale projects — **Fact:** Benefit estimation can be applied to projects of any size, as seen in the example of small businesses using **break-even analysis** to estimate the benefits of investing in new equipment (Brealey et al.).
- **Myth:** Benefit estimation is a one-time process — **Fact:** Benefit estimation is an ongoing process that requires continuous monitoring and updating, as market conditions and project circumstances change, as described by **Porter's five forces model** (Porter, 1979).
- **Myth:** Benefit estimation only considers financial benefits — **Fact:** Benefit estimation can consider non-financial benefits, such as environmental or social impacts, as seen in the example of the **United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals** (United Nations).
- **Myth:** Benefit estimation is a precise science — **Fact:** Benefit estimation involves uncertainty and requires the use of **probability theory** and **statistics** to account for potential risks and uncertainties, as described by **Knight's distinction between risk and uncertainty** (Knight, 1921).

## In Practice
The city of Copenhagen, Denmark, conducted a benefit estimation of its investment in a new **bike-sharing system**, which included estimating the potential benefits of reduced traffic congestion, improved air quality, and increased tourism revenue. The estimation was based on data from similar bike-sharing systems in other cities, such as **Paris's Velib system**, and took into account the potential costs of implementing and maintaining the system. The estimated benefits of the project included a reduction in traffic congestion of ~10% (Copenhagen City Council), an improvement in air quality of ~5% (European Environment Agency), and an increase in tourism revenue of ~15% (Copenhagen Tourism). The project was deemed viable based on the estimated benefits, and the bike-sharing system has since been successfully implemented, with ~60,000 users (Copenhagen City Council).
