# What Benefit Estimation Depends On

Accurate **project scope definition** is the most critical dependency for benefit estimation, as it determines the boundaries and deliverables of a project, and without it, benefit estimation is unreliable and may lead to project failure, as seen in the case of the Berlin Brandenburg Airport, where inadequate scope definition resulted in a €5 billion cost overrun (Berlin Brandenburg Airport report).

## Key Dependencies
- **Well-defined project objectives** — clear objectives are necessary to establish a basis for benefit estimation, and without them, it is difficult to determine the project's success criteria, as exemplified by the Denver International Airport baggage handling system, which failed to meet its objectives due to unclear requirements, resulting in a $1.1 million daily loss (Denver International Airport report).
- **Stakeholder engagement** — stakeholder input is essential to ensure that benefits are aligned with their expectations, and without it, benefits may not be realized, as seen in the case of the UK's National Health Service IT project, which failed to engage clinicians, resulting in a £10 billion waste (UK National Audit Office).
- **Benefit measurement framework** — a framework is necessary to establish a structured approach to benefit estimation, and without it, benefits may not be accurately measured, as exemplified by the Australian government's failed attempt to introduce a national broadband network, which lacked a clear benefit measurement framework, resulting in a $20 billion cost blowout (Australian Government report).
- **Risk assessment** — identifying and mitigating risks is crucial to ensure that benefits are not compromised by unforeseen events, and without it, benefits may be overestimated, as seen in the case of the Quebec Bridge construction project, which failed to assess risks, resulting in a $100 million cost overrun (Quebec Bridge report).
- **Data quality** — accurate and reliable data is necessary to support benefit estimation, and without it, benefits may be misestimated, as exemplified by the US Census Bureau's attempt to use faulty data, which resulted in a $1.5 billion waste (US Census Bureau report).

## Priority Order
The dependencies can be ranked in order of criticality as follows:
1. **Project scope definition** — this is the most critical dependency, as it determines the boundaries and deliverables of a project, and without it, benefit estimation is unreliable.
2. **Well-defined project objectives** — clear objectives are necessary to establish a basis for benefit estimation, and without them, it is difficult to determine the project's success criteria.
3. **Benefit measurement framework** — a framework is necessary to establish a structured approach to benefit estimation, and without it, benefits may not be accurately measured.
4. **Stakeholder engagement** — stakeholder input is essential to ensure that benefits are aligned with their expectations, and without it, benefits may not be realized.
5. **Risk assessment** — identifying and mitigating risks is crucial to ensure that benefits are not compromised by unforeseen events.
6. **Data quality** — accurate and reliable data is necessary to support benefit estimation, and without it, benefits may be misestimated.

## Common Gaps
People often overlook the importance of **assessing dependencies** and **validating assumptions**, which can lead to project failure, as seen in the case of the Scottish Parliament building project, which failed to assess dependencies and validate assumptions, resulting in a £400 million cost overrun (Scottish Parliament report).
