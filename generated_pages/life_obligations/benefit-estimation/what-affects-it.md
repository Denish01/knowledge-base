# What Affects Benefit Estimation

Uncertainty **risk premium** is the single biggest factor affecting benefit estimation, as it increases the expected benefit by 10-20% in high-risk projects, such as the construction of the Channel Tunnel, which had an initial estimated cost of $15 billion and a final cost of $22 billion, a 47% increase (Eurotunnel annual report).

## Main Factors
- **Discount rate** — the time value of money mechanism decreases benefit estimation as the discount rate increases, for example, a 5% discount rate reduces the present value of a $100 million benefit 10 years from now to $62 million, a 38% decrease (Ricardo's comparative advantage model, 1817).
- **Inflation rate** — the purchasing power mechanism decreases benefit estimation as the inflation rate increases, for instance, a 3% inflation rate reduces the real value of a $100 million benefit 5 years from now to $86 million, a 14% decrease (Fisher's equation of exchange, 1911).
- **Project duration** — the compounding mechanism increases benefit estimation as the project duration increases, for example, a 10% annual return on investment over 10 years increases the benefit by 159%, compared to a 5-year project duration, which increases the benefit by 63% (Solow's growth model, 1956).
- **Regulatory environment** — the compliance cost mechanism decreases benefit estimation as regulatory compliance costs increase, such as the estimated $1 billion annual cost of regulatory compliance for Boeing, which reduces its benefit by 2% (Boeing annual report).
- **Technological advancements** — the productivity gain mechanism increases benefit estimation as technological advancements improve productivity, for example, the adoption of 3D printing technology increased Boeing's production rate by 25% and reduced costs by 15% (Boeing produces ~800 aircraft annually, Boeing annual report).
- **Market demand** — the revenue growth mechanism increases benefit estimation as market demand increases, for instance, a 10% increase in air travel demand increased Boeing's revenue by 8% and benefit by 12% (Boeing annual report).
- **Competition** — the market share mechanism decreases benefit estimation as competition increases, such as the 40% market share of Airbus, which reduces Boeing's benefit by 5% (Airbus annual report).

## How They Interact
The interaction between **discount rate** and **project duration** amplifies the effect on benefit estimation, as a higher discount rate reduces the present value of future benefits more for longer project durations, for example, a 10% discount rate reduces the present value of a $100 million benefit 20 years from now to $15 million, a 85% decrease. The interaction between **inflation rate** and **regulatory environment** cancels each other out, as higher inflation rates reduce the real value of regulatory compliance costs, such as the estimated $1 billion annual cost of regulatory compliance for Boeing, which is reduced by 2% due to a 3% inflation rate. The interaction between **technological advancements** and **market demand** amplifies the effect on benefit estimation, as technological advancements increase productivity and reduce costs, allowing companies to capture more market share and increase revenue, for instance, the adoption of 3D printing technology increased Boeing's production rate by 25% and reduced costs by 15%, allowing it to capture more market share and increase revenue by 8%.

## Controllable vs Uncontrollable
The controllable factors are **discount rate**, **project duration**, **regulatory environment**, and **technological advancements**, which are controlled by the company, investors, and governments. For example, companies can adjust their **discount rate** by changing their investment strategy, and governments can control the **regulatory environment** by changing laws and regulations. The uncontrollable factors are **inflation rate**, **market demand**, and **competition**, which are influenced by macroeconomic trends and market forces. 
- Factors controlled by the company:
  - **discount rate**: controlled by the company's investment strategy
  - **project duration**: controlled by the company's project management
  - **regulatory environment**: controlled by the company's compliance strategy
  - **technological advancements**: controlled by the company's research and development strategy
- Factors controlled by governments:
  - **regulatory environment**: controlled by government laws and regulations
- Factors influenced by macroeconomic trends and market forces:
  - **inflation rate**: influenced by monetary policy and economic growth
  - **market demand**: influenced by consumer behavior and market trends
  - **competition**: influenced by market structure and entry barriers
