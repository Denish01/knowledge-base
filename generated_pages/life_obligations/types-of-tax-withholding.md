# What is Types Of Tax Withholding?

## INTRODUCTION
Tax withholding refers to the process by which employers deduct a portion of an employee's wages and pay it to the government as a way of prepaying the employee's tax liability. Understanding the different types of tax withholding is crucial for both employers and employees, as it helps ensure compliance with tax laws and regulations. Classification of tax withholding types matters because it enables individuals and businesses to navigate the complex tax system, avoid penalties, and take advantage of available tax credits and deductions. By categorizing tax withholding into distinct types, individuals can better comprehend their tax obligations and make informed decisions about their financial planning.

## MAIN CATEGORIES
The following are the primary types of tax withholding:

1. **Federal Income Tax Withholding**
   - Brief definition: Federal income tax withholding is the amount deducted from an employee's paycheck to pay their federal income tax liability. This amount is based on the employee's income, filing status, and number of dependents.
   - Key characteristics: Federal income tax withholding is typically calculated using the employee's W-4 form, which provides information about their tax filing status, number of dependents, and other relevant details.
   - Simple example: If an employee earns $1,000 per week and is single with no dependents, their federal income tax withholding might be $150, depending on their tax bracket and other factors.

2. **State and Local Tax Withholding**
   - Brief definition: State and local tax withholding refers to the amount deducted from an employee's paycheck to pay their state and local income tax liability. This amount varies depending on the state and locality in which the employee resides.
   - Key characteristics: State and local tax withholding rates differ significantly across jurisdictions, with some states having no income tax at all.
   - Simple example: An employee living in New York City might have 6.5% of their income withheld for state income tax and an additional 3.65% for local income tax.

3. **Social Security Tax Withholding**
   - Brief definition: Social Security tax withholding, also known as Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI), is a type of tax withholding that funds social security benefits for eligible recipients. This tax is typically withheld at a rate of 6.2% of an employee's earnings, with the employer matching this amount.
   - Key characteristics: Social Security tax withholding has a wage base limit, beyond which no additional Social Security taxes are withheld.
   - Simple example: If an employee earns $100,000 per year, they might have 6.2% of their income withheld for Social Security taxes, up to the wage base limit.

4. **Medicare Tax Withholding**
   - Brief definition: Medicare tax withholding is a type of tax withholding that funds healthcare benefits for eligible recipients. This tax is typically withheld at a rate of 1.45% of an employee's earnings, with the employer matching this amount.
   - Key characteristics: Medicare tax withholding has no wage base limit, and high-income earners may be subject to an additional Medicare tax.
   - Simple example: An employee earning $200,000 per year might have 1.45% of their income withheld for Medicare taxes, plus an additional 0.9% for the high-income Medicare tax.

## COMPARISON TABLE
| Type of Tax Withholding | Rate | Wage Base Limit | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Federal Income Tax | Varies | No limit | 15% of $1,000 |
| State and Local Tax | Varies | No limit | 6.5% of $1,000 (state), 3.65% of $1,000 (local) |
| Social Security Tax | 6.2% | Yes | 6.2% of $100,000 |
| Medicare Tax | 1.45% | No limit | 1.45% of $200,000 |

## HOW THEY RELATE
The different types of tax withholding are interconnected in that they all contribute to an individual's overall tax liability. Federal income tax withholding, for example, is affected by the amount of Social Security and Medicare taxes withheld, as these amounts are deductible from an individual's gross income. Additionally, state and local tax withholding can impact an individual's federal income tax liability, as these amounts may be deductible on their federal tax return. Understanding how these types of tax withholding relate to one another is essential for accurate tax planning and compliance.

## SUMMARY
The classification system of tax withholding includes federal income tax withholding, state and local tax withholding, Social Security tax withholding, and Medicare tax withholding, each with its own distinct characteristics and rates, which together comprise an individual's overall tax liability.
