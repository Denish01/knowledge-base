# What is What Guardianship Depends On?

1. INTRODUCTION
Guardianship is a legal relationship where one person, the guardian, is responsible for the care and well-being of another person, often a minor or an individual with disabilities. The establishment and maintenance of guardianship depend on various factors, which are crucial for ensuring the welfare and protection of the individual under guardianship. Understanding these dependencies is essential for navigating the complexities of guardianship and making informed decisions.

2. KEY DEPENDENCIES
Several key factors contribute to the foundation of guardianship. These include:
- The dependency: Legal authority
  Why it's necessary: Legal authority is necessary to establish and enforce the guardian's rights and responsibilities.
  What happens without it: Without legal authority, the guardian may not have the power to make decisions on behalf of the individual, leading to potential conflicts and instability.
- The dependency: Capacity of the individual
  Why it's necessary: The individual's capacity, or lack thereof, determines the need for guardianship and the scope of the guardian's responsibilities.
  What happens without it: Without assessing the individual's capacity, the guardian may not provide adequate care or make appropriate decisions, potentially harming the individual.
- The dependency: Financial resources
  Why it's necessary: Financial resources are necessary to provide for the individual's basic needs, such as food, shelter, and medical care.
  What happens without it: Without sufficient financial resources, the guardian may struggle to provide adequate care, leading to neglect or instability.
- The dependency: Support network
  Why it's necessary: A support network, including family, friends, and professionals, is necessary to provide emotional and practical assistance to the guardian and the individual.
  What happens without it: Without a support network, the guardian may become overwhelmed, leading to burnout or inadequate care for the individual.
- The dependency: Ongoing evaluation and monitoring
  Why it's necessary: Ongoing evaluation and monitoring are necessary to ensure the guardian is acting in the best interests of the individual and to identify any changes in the individual's needs or circumstances.
  What happens without it: Without ongoing evaluation and monitoring, the guardian may not adapt to changing circumstances, potentially leading to inadequate care or neglect.

3. ORDER OF IMPORTANCE
While all dependencies are crucial, legal authority and the individual's capacity are the most critical factors. These two dependencies provide the foundation for the guardian's role and responsibilities. Financial resources, support network, and ongoing evaluation and monitoring are also essential, but they build upon the initial establishment of legal authority and assessment of the individual's capacity.

4. COMMON GAPS
People often overlook or assume certain aspects of guardianship, such as the need for ongoing evaluation and monitoring or the importance of a support network. Additionally, individuals may assume that financial resources are the primary consideration, neglecting the significance of legal authority and the individual's capacity.

5. SUMMARY
In conclusion, guardianship depends on a combination of legal authority, the individual's capacity, financial resources, a support network, and ongoing evaluation and monitoring. Understanding these dependencies is essential for establishing and maintaining effective guardianship. By recognizing the critical role each factor plays, individuals can provide the necessary care and protection for those under their guardianship, ensuring their well-being and safety. A thorough understanding of these prerequisites is the foundation upon which successful guardianship is built.
