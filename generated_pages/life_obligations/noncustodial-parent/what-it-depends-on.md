# What is What Noncustodial Parent Depends On?

1. INTRODUCTION:
A noncustodial parent is a parent who does not have primary physical custody of their child. Understanding the dependencies of a noncustodial parent is crucial as it affects their ability to provide for their child's well-being and maintain a healthy relationship. The various dependencies that a noncustodial parent relies on can have a significant impact on their role and responsibilities. In this explanation, we will explore the key dependencies that a noncustodial parent depends on.

2. KEY DEPENDENCIES:
- The dependency: A stable income
  Why it's necessary: A stable income is necessary for a noncustodial parent to provide financial support for their child, including paying child support and covering expenses related to visitation.
  What happens without it: Without a stable income, a noncustodial parent may struggle to provide adequate financial support, potentially affecting their child's quality of life.
- The dependency: A functional co-parenting relationship
  Why it's necessary: A functional co-parenting relationship is necessary for a noncustodial parent to stay informed about their child's needs, make joint decisions, and cooperate on parenting responsibilities.
  What happens without it: Without a functional co-parenting relationship, a noncustodial parent may experience difficulties in communicating with their child's other parent, leading to potential conflicts and negatively impacting their child's well-being.
- The dependency: Access to the child's information
  Why it's necessary: Access to the child's information, such as their schedule, medical history, and educational records, is necessary for a noncustodial parent to make informed decisions and provide proper care during visitation.
  What happens without it: Without access to the child's information, a noncustodial parent may be unable to provide adequate care, potentially putting their child's health and well-being at risk.
- The dependency: A visitation schedule
  Why it's necessary: A visitation schedule is necessary for a noncustodial parent to maintain a consistent and predictable relationship with their child, allowing for regular interaction and bonding.
  What happens without it: Without a visitation schedule, a noncustodial parent may experience uncertainty and inconsistency in their interactions with their child, potentially leading to feelings of disconnection and affecting their child's emotional well-being.
- The dependency: Emotional support
  Why it's necessary: Emotional support from family, friends, or a therapist is necessary for a noncustodial parent to cope with the emotional challenges of not having primary custody, such as feelings of guilt, anxiety, or sadness.
  What happens without it: Without emotional support, a noncustodial parent may struggle to manage their emotions, potentially affecting their mental health and ability to provide a stable and nurturing environment for their child.

3. ORDER OF IMPORTANCE:
While all dependencies are crucial, a stable income and a functional co-parenting relationship are particularly critical. These two dependencies provide the foundation for a noncustodial parent to fulfill their financial and emotional responsibilities. Access to the child's information and a visitation schedule are also essential, as they enable a noncustodial parent to provide proper care and maintain a consistent relationship with their child. Emotional support, although important for the noncustodial parent's well-being, is slightly less critical in terms of immediate impact on the child's daily life.

4. COMMON GAPS:
People often overlook the importance of a functional co-parenting relationship and access to the child's information. They may assume that these aspects will naturally fall into place or that they are not essential. However, neglecting these dependencies can lead to significant challenges and conflicts, ultimately affecting the well-being of the child.

5. SUMMARY:
The role of a noncustodial parent is built upon several essential dependencies, including a stable income, a functional co-parenting relationship, access to the child's information, a visitation schedule, and emotional support. Understanding and addressing these dependencies is crucial for a noncustodial parent to provide a stable and nurturing environment for their child. By recognizing the importance of these prerequisites, noncustodial parents can better navigate their responsibilities and work towards maintaining a healthy and loving relationship with their child.
