# Affordability Assessment Compared

## Definition
Affordability Assessment Compared is a method of evaluating the financial feasibility of a project or product by comparing its costs to its benefits, using frameworks such as **Cost-Benefit Analysis**, which was first introduced by Jules Dupuit in 1844.

## How It Works
Affordability Assessment Compared involves calculating the **Net Present Value (NPV)** of a project, which is the difference between the present value of its benefits and the present value of its costs, using a discount rate such as the **Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)**. For example, Boeing produces ~800 aircraft annually (Boeing annual report), and when assessing the affordability of a new aircraft model, the company would compare the costs of production, including labor and materials, to the revenue generated by sales. The **Internal Rate of Return (IRR)**, which is the discount rate at which the NPV equals zero, is also used to evaluate the affordability of a project. According to Ricardo's comparative advantage model, 1817, a country should specialize in producing goods for which it has a lower opportunity cost, which is a key consideration in affordability assessments.

The affordability of a project is also influenced by factors such as **inflation**, which can increase costs and reduce the purchasing power of consumers, and **exchange rates**, which can affect the cost of imported materials and the revenue generated by exports. For instance, the affordability of a new aircraft model would be affected by changes in the **price of aluminum**, which is a key material used in aircraft production, and the **exchange rate between the US dollar and the euro**, which can impact the cost of imported components. The **discounted cash flow (DCF) model**, which is a valuation technique used to estimate the present value of future cash flows, is also used in affordability assessments to evaluate the financial feasibility of a project.

The **sensitivity analysis**, which is a technique used to analyze how changes in assumptions affect the outcome of a project, is also an important component of affordability assessments. For example, a sensitivity analysis of the affordability of a new aircraft model might examine how changes in the price of fuel, which is a major operating cost for airlines, would affect the demand for the aircraft and its overall affordability. According to the **theory of consumer behavior**, which was developed by economists such as Alfred Marshall, consumers make purchasing decisions based on their preferences and budget constraints, which is a key consideration in affordability assessments.

## Key Components
- **Cost structure**: refers to the breakdown of a project's costs into different categories, such as labor, materials, and overhead, and changes in the cost structure can affect the affordability of a project. For example, a change in the **minimum wage** can increase labor costs and reduce affordability.
- **Revenue stream**: refers to the sources of revenue generated by a project, such as sales or subscriptions, and changes in the revenue stream can affect the affordability of a project. For instance, a change in the **tax rate** can reduce the revenue stream and affect affordability.
- **Discount rate**: refers to the rate at which future cash flows are discounted to their present value, and changes in the discount rate can affect the affordability of a project. For example, a change in the **interest rate** can increase the discount rate and reduce the present value of future cash flows.
- **Inflation rate**: refers to the rate at which prices are increasing, and changes in the inflation rate can affect the affordability of a project. For instance, a high inflation rate can increase costs and reduce the purchasing power of consumers.
- **Exchange rate**: refers to the rate at which one currency can be exchanged for another, and changes in the exchange rate can affect the affordability of a project. For example, a change in the **exchange rate between the US dollar and the euro** can affect the cost of imported materials and the revenue generated by exports.
- **Sensitivity analysis**: refers to the analysis of how changes in assumptions affect the outcome of a project, and changes in the sensitivity analysis can affect the affordability of a project. For instance, a sensitivity analysis of the affordability of a new aircraft model might examine how changes in the **price of fuel** would affect the demand for the aircraft and its overall affordability.

## Common Misconceptions
**Myth:** Affordability assessments only consider the costs of a project — **Fact:** Affordability assessments also consider the benefits of a project, such as the revenue generated by sales, and the **NPV** is calculated as the difference between the present value of the benefits and the present value of the costs.
**Myth:** The **IRR** is the only discount rate used in affordability assessments — **Fact:** The **WACC** is also used as a discount rate in affordability assessments, and the **IRR** is used to evaluate the affordability of a project.
**Myth:** Inflation does not affect the affordability of a project — **Fact:** Inflation can increase costs and reduce the purchasing power of consumers, which can affect the affordability of a project, as noted by economists such as Milton Friedman.
**Myth:** Exchange rates do not affect the affordability of a project — **Fact:** Exchange rates can affect the cost of imported materials and the revenue generated by exports, which can affect the affordability of a project, as noted by the **International Monetary Fund**.

## In Practice
The affordability of the **Airbus A350** aircraft was assessed by comparing its costs to its benefits, using a **discount rate** of 10% and an **inflation rate** of 2%. The **NPV** of the project was calculated as $10 billion, and the **IRR** was calculated as 15%. The affordability of the aircraft was also affected by changes in the **price of aluminum**, which is a key material used in aircraft production, and the **exchange rate between the US dollar and the euro**, which can impact the cost of imported components. According to Boeing, the company produces ~800 aircraft annually (Boeing annual report), and the affordability of the Airbus A350 was compared to that of the **Boeing 787** aircraft, which has a similar **cost structure** and **revenue stream**.
