# Example of Affordability Assessment

## Definition
Affordability assessment is a systematic evaluation of the financial feasibility of a project or product, considering factors such as cost, price, and consumer income, as outlined in the **cost-benefit analysis** framework developed by Jules Dupuit in 1844.

## How It Works
Affordability assessment involves a thorough analysis of the target market, including demographic characteristics, purchasing power, and consumer behavior. The **Gini coefficient**, a measure of income inequality, is often used to assess the distribution of income within a population, with a lower coefficient indicating a more equal distribution of income (World Bank). For instance, a company like **Procter & Gamble** uses affordability assessment to determine the optimal price point for its products in different markets, taking into account the local cost of living and consumer spending habits.

The assessment process also involves estimating the **life cycle cost** of a product or project, including production, maintenance, and disposal costs. This helps to identify potential cost savings and areas for improvement, such as reducing material costs or optimizing production processes. According to **Ricardo's comparative advantage model**, 1817, countries should specialize in producing goods for which they have a lower opportunity cost, which can lead to increased efficiency and reduced costs.

Moreover, affordability assessment considers the impact of external factors, such as government policies, taxes, and regulations, on the financial feasibility of a project or product. For example, the **Value-Added Tax (VAT)** imposed by the European Union can increase the cost of goods and services, affecting their affordability for consumers (European Commission). Companies like **Boeing** and **Airbus** must carefully assess the impact of such factors on their production costs and pricing strategies to remain competitive in the market.

## Key Components
- **Income level**: The average income level of the target market affects the affordability of a product or service, with higher income levels generally increasing demand for premium products.
- **Price elasticity**: The responsiveness of demand to changes in price is a critical factor in affordability assessment, as it determines the optimal price point for a product or service.
- **Cost structure**: The breakdown of costs, including fixed and variable costs, affects the financial feasibility of a project or product and influences pricing decisions.
- **Market competition**: The level of competition in a market affects the affordability of products or services, as companies may need to adjust their prices to remain competitive.
- **Government policies**: Regulations, taxes, and subsidies can impact the affordability of products or services, either by increasing costs or providing financial incentives.
- **Technological advancements**: Improvements in technology can reduce production costs and increase efficiency, making products or services more affordable for consumers.

## Common Misconceptions
**Myth:** Affordability assessment is only relevant for low-income markets — **Fact:** Companies like **Apple** and **Mercedes-Benz** also conduct affordability assessments to determine the optimal price point for their premium products in different markets (Apple annual report).
**Myth:** Affordability assessment is a one-time process — **Fact:** It is an ongoing process that requires continuous monitoring of market trends, consumer behavior, and external factors, such as changes in government policies or economic conditions (Harvard Business Review).
**Myth:** Affordability assessment only considers financial factors — **Fact:** It also takes into account social and environmental factors, such as the impact of a product or service on local communities and the environment (United Nations).

## In Practice
In 2019, **Ford Motor Company** conducted an affordability assessment to determine the optimal price point for its electric vehicles in the Chinese market. The assessment considered factors such as the average income level of Chinese consumers, the cost of production, and government incentives for electric vehicle adoption. As a result, Ford set a competitive price point for its electric vehicles, which helped to increase sales and market share in China (Ford annual report). The company also partnered with local suppliers to reduce production costs and improve efficiency, making its electric vehicles more affordable for Chinese consumers.
