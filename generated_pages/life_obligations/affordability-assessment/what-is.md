# What Is Affordability Assessment?

Affordability assessment refers to the evaluation of the financial feasibility of a product, service, or project, taking into account factors such as cost, price, income, and expenditure, with the goal of determining whether it is affordable for a particular group of people, as outlined in Maslow's hierarchy of needs, 1943.

## Definition
Affordability assessment is a crucial step in the development and implementation of products, services, and projects, as it helps to identify potential financial constraints and barriers to access, with the World Bank estimating that ~2.5 billion people lack access to basic financial services (World Bank).

## How It Works
The affordability assessment process typically involves a comprehensive analysis of the target market, including demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, such as income levels, expenditure patterns, and debt obligations, with the US Census Bureau reporting that the median household income in the United States is ~$67,000 (US Census Bureau). This analysis is often conducted using frameworks such as the **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)** model, which takes into account all the costs associated with a product or service, including acquisition, operation, and maintenance costs, with a study by Gartner finding that TCO can be up to 3-4 times the initial purchase price.

The assessment also involves evaluating the pricing strategy and revenue model, including factors such as pricing elasticity, competition, and market trends, with the **Ricardo's comparative advantage model, 1817**, providing a framework for analyzing the relative costs and benefits of different pricing strategies. Additionally, the assessment may involve simulating different scenarios and conducting sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of the financial projections, with **Monte Carlo simulations** being a commonly used method for modeling uncertainty and risk.

The affordability assessment process can be applied to a wide range of products and services, from consumer goods to infrastructure projects, with the **Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA)** framework being a widely used method for evaluating the financial viability of large-scale projects, such as the construction of a new highway or the development of a renewable energy facility, with the European Commission estimating that the cost of building a new highway can be up to ~$10 million per kilometer (European Commission).

## Key Components
- **Income level**: The income level of the target market affects their ability to afford a product or service, with higher income levels generally corresponding to greater affordability, and the World Bank reporting that ~1.9 billion people live on less than $3.20 per day (World Bank).
- **Expenditure pattern**: The expenditure pattern of the target market, including their spending habits and priorities, can impact their ability to afford a product or service, with the US Bureau of Labor Statistics reporting that the average American household spends ~$63,000 per year (US Bureau of Labor Statistics).
- **Debt obligation**: The debt obligations of the target market, including credit card debt, mortgages, and other loans, can affect their ability to afford a product or service, with the Federal Reserve reporting that the total household debt in the United States is ~$14 trillion (Federal Reserve).
- **Pricing strategy**: The pricing strategy of a product or service can impact its affordability, with pricing strategies such as **price skimming** and **penetration pricing** being used to balance profitability and affordability, and the **Nash equilibrium** model providing a framework for analyzing the pricing strategies of competing firms.
- **Revenue model**: The revenue model of a product or service can impact its affordability, with revenue models such as **subscription-based** and **advertising-based** being used to generate revenue while keeping costs low, and the **Pareto principle** providing a framework for analyzing the distribution of revenue and costs.
- **Regulatory environment**: The regulatory environment can impact the affordability of a product or service, with regulations such as **price controls** and **taxation** affecting the pricing strategy and revenue model, and the **Laffer curve** providing a framework for analyzing the impact of taxation on economic activity.

## Common Misconceptions
- **Myth:** Affordability assessment is only relevant for low-income households — **Fact:** Affordability assessment is relevant for all income levels, as even high-income households can face financial constraints and barriers to access, with the US Federal Reserve reporting that ~40% of Americans cannot afford a $400 emergency expense (Federal Reserve).
- **Myth:** Affordability assessment is a one-time process — **Fact:** Affordability assessment is an ongoing process that requires continuous monitoring and evaluation, as market conditions and consumer behavior can change rapidly, with the **Black-Scholes model** providing a framework for analyzing the impact of changing market conditions on financial projections.
- **Myth:** Affordability assessment is only relevant for consumer goods — **Fact:** Affordability assessment is relevant for all types of products and services, including infrastructure projects and public services, with the **cost-effectiveness analysis** framework being used to evaluate the financial viability of large-scale projects.
- **Myth:** Affordability assessment is a simple process — **Fact:** Affordability assessment is a complex process that requires specialized expertise and tools, such as **financial modeling** and **data analysis**, with the **Six Sigma** methodology providing a framework for analyzing and improving the affordability assessment process.

## In Practice
The city of Copenhagen, Denmark, conducted an affordability assessment for a new public transportation system, including a metro line and bus network, with the goal of determining whether the system would be affordable for low-income households, and the **cost-benefit analysis** framework being used to evaluate the financial viability of the project, with the city estimating that the total cost of the project would be ~$1.2 billion (City of Copenhagen). The assessment involved analyzing the income levels and expenditure patterns of the target market, as well as the pricing strategy and revenue model of the transportation system, with the **Nash equilibrium** model being used to analyze the pricing strategies of competing transportation providers, and the **Pareto principle** being used to analyze the distribution of revenue and costs. The assessment found that the transportation system would be affordable for most households, but that some low-income households would require subsidies or other forms of assistance, with the city implementing a **means-tested** fare system to ensure that the system would be affordable for all households.
