  "content": "Income level is the most critical dependency for affordability assessment, as it directly affects an individual's ability to pay for goods and services, with a notable example being the housing market crisis in 2008, where subprime lending to borrowers with insufficient income led to widespread defaults and a global economic downturn.\n\n## Key Dependencies\n- **Income level** \u2014 required to determine an individual's purchasing power, and without it, lenders may extend credit to borrowers who cannot afford repayments, as seen in the 2008 housing market crisis, where many borrowers defaulted on their mortgages due to insufficient income.\n- **Debt obligations** \u2014 necessary to assess an individual's existing financial commitments, and without it, lenders may not account for other debts, such as credit card debt, leading to overextension of credit, as experienced by many borrowers in the US, where credit card debt has been steadily increasing, with the average household holding ~$4,700 in credit card debt (Federal Reserve).\n- **Credit history** \u2014 essential to evaluate an individual's creditworthiness, and without it, lenders may not accurately assess the risk of lending, as seen in the case of Wells Fargo, which was fined for opening unauthorized credit accounts, resulting in damaged credit scores for many customers.\n- **Expense profile** \u2014 needed to understand an individual's spending habits, and without it, lenders may not account for essential expenses, such as rent or mortgage payments, leading to inaccurate affordability assessments, as experienced by many borrowers in the UK, where mortgage lenders were criticized for not adequately considering borrowers' expenses.\n- **Market conditions** \u2014 required to assess the current state of the economy and industry trends, and without it, lenders may not adjust their lending criteria to reflect changes in the market, as seen in the case of the Australian housing market, where lenders failed to account for a decline in housing prices, leading to a surge in mortgage defaults.\n- **Regulatory requirements** \u2014 necessary to ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations, and without it, lenders may face legal and financial penalties, as experienced by many banks in the US, which were fined for non-compliance with the Dodd-Frank Act.\n\n## Priority Order\nThe dependencies can be ranked in the following order from most to least critical:\n- **Income level**, as it directly affects an individual's ability to pay for goods and services\n- **Debt obligations**, as it provides a comprehensive view of an individual's financial commitments\n- **Credit history**, as it helps lenders assess the risk of lending\n- **Expense profile**, as it provides insight into an individual's spending habits\n- **Market conditions**, as it allows lenders to adjust their lending criteria to reflect changes in the market\n- **Regulatory requirements**, as it ensures compliance with relevant laws and regulations, but is often already accounted for in the lending process.\n\n## Common Gaps\nA common assumption is that **credit score** is the primary indicator of creditworthiness, which can lead to overlooking other essential factors, such as debt obligations and expense profile, resulting in inaccurate affordability assessments, as seen in the case of many lenders that rely heavily on credit scores, only to find that borrowers with high credit scores still default on their loans due to high debt levels or unstable income.",
