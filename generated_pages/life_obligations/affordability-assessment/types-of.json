  "content": "There are four primary types of affordability assessment, categorized by their focus on financial, social, economic, and environmental aspects. \n## Main Categories\n- **Income-Based Assessment** \u2014 determines affordability based on the ratio of housing costs to household income, with distinguishing characteristics including consideration of debt-to-income ratio and credit score, as seen in the **30% Rule** used by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n- **Cost-Benefit Analysis** \u2014 evaluates affordability by comparing the costs of a project or investment to its expected benefits, with characteristics including consideration of opportunity costs and risk assessment, as used by the **UK's National Audit Office** to assess the affordability of large-scale infrastructure projects.\n- **Life-Cycle Costing** \u2014 assesses affordability by considering the total cost of ownership or investment over its entire life cycle, with characteristics including consideration of maintenance, repair, and replacement costs, as used by **Boeing** to evaluate the affordability of its aircraft.\n- **Social Impact Assessment** \u2014 determines affordability based on the potential social impacts of a project or investment, with characteristics including consideration of effects on community cohesion, health, and education, as used by the **World Health Organization** to assess the affordability of healthcare interventions.\n\n## Comparison Table\n| Category | Cost Focus | Scale | Speed |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Income-Based Assessment | Household income | Individual | Rapid |\n| Cost-Benefit Analysis | Project costs | Large-scale | Medium |\n| Life-Cycle Costing | Total cost of ownership | Long-term | Slow |\n| Social Impact Assessment | Social costs | Community | Variable |\n\n## How They Relate\nThe categories overlap in several ways, with **Income-Based Assessment** and **Cost-Benefit Analysis** often informing each other in the evaluation of large-scale projects, such as the **UK's High-Speed 2 rail project**, which considered both the financial affordability of the project and its potential social impacts. \n- **Life-Cycle Costing** and **Social Impact Assessment** are commonly used in conjunction to evaluate the long-term affordability of investments, such as the **US Department of Defense's** use of life-cycle costing to evaluate the affordability of its military equipment, while also considering the social impacts of its procurement decisions.\n- **Cost-Benefit Analysis** and **Social Impact Assessment** are often confused, but they serve distinct purposes, with cost-benefit analysis focusing on the financial aspects of a project and social impact assessment considering the broader social effects, as seen in the **European Commission's** use of both frameworks to evaluate the affordability and social impacts of its policies.",
