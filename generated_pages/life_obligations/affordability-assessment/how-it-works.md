# How Affordability Assessment Works

Affordability assessment is a mechanism that evaluates an individual's or household's ability to pay for a product or service, typically involving an analysis of income, expenses, debts, and credit history to determine the maximum amount they can afford to spend.

## The Mechanism
The core cause-and-effect chain of affordability assessment involves the input of financial data, such as income and expenses, which is then processed using **financial ratios**, such as the debt-to-income ratio, to produce an output of an affordability score or a maximum affordable amount. This score is then used to determine the individual's or household's eligibility for a loan or credit.

## Step-by-Step
1. **Data collection**: The individual or household provides financial data, including income, expenses, debts, and credit history, which is used as input for the affordability assessment. This data is typically collected through a survey or application form, and may involve verification of income and expenses through documentation such as pay stubs and bank statements, resulting in a data set with a minimum of 10-15 data points.
2. **Expense categorization**: The collected data is then categorized into different expense types, such as housing, transportation, and food, using a framework such as the **50/30/20 rule**, which allocates 50% of income towards necessary expenses, 30% towards discretionary spending, and 20% towards saving and debt repayment. This categorization helps to identify areas where expenses can be reduced or optimized, resulting in an average reduction of 10-20% in expenses.
3. **Debt-to-income ratio calculation**: The debt-to-income ratio is calculated by dividing the total monthly debt payments by the total monthly income, using a formula such as the **Gross Debt Service (GDS) ratio**, which is commonly used in mortgage lending. For example, if an individual has a monthly income of $4,000 and monthly debt payments of $1,200, their debt-to-income ratio would be 30%, indicating a moderate level of debt.
4. **Credit score evaluation**: The individual's or household's credit score is evaluated using a model such as **FICO**, which takes into account payment history, credit utilization, and credit age. A credit score of 700 or higher is generally considered good, while a score below 600 may indicate a higher risk of default, resulting in a 1-2% increase in interest rates.
5. **Affordability score calculation**: The affordability score is calculated using a formula that takes into account the debt-to-income ratio, credit score, and other factors, such as income stability and employment history, using a framework such as the **Housing Affordability Index**, which is used to evaluate the affordability of housing in different regions. For example, an individual with a debt-to-income ratio of 30%, a credit score of 750, and a stable income may receive an affordability score of 80, indicating a high level of affordability.
6. **Maximum affordable amount determination**: The maximum affordable amount is determined based on the affordability score, using a formula such as the **28/36 rule**, which allocates 28% of income towards housing expenses and 36% towards total debt payments. For example, if an individual has an affordability score of 80 and a monthly income of $4,000, their maximum affordable amount for a mortgage payment may be $1,120.

## Key Components
- **Income**: The individual's or household's income is a critical component of affordability assessment, as it determines their ability to pay for expenses and debts. If income is reduced or unstable, it may negatively impact the affordability score.
- **Expenses**: Expenses, such as housing, transportation, and food, are also critical components, as they determine the individual's or household's monthly outgoings. If expenses are high or unpredictable, it may negatively impact the affordability score.
- **Debts**: Debts, such as credit card debt, student loans, and mortgages, are another key component, as they determine the individual's or household's monthly debt payments. If debts are high or have high interest rates, it may negatively impact the affordability score.
- **Credit history**: Credit history is also an important component, as it determines the individual's or household's creditworthiness and ability to access credit. If credit history is poor or limited, it may negatively impact the affordability score.

## Common Questions
What happens if an individual's income is reduced? If an individual's income is reduced, their affordability score may be negatively impacted, resulting in a lower maximum affordable amount for a loan or credit.
What is the impact of a high debt-to-income ratio on affordability? A high debt-to-income ratio can negatively impact affordability, as it indicates that the individual or household has a high level of debt relative to their income, resulting in a higher risk of default.
How does credit score affect affordability? A good credit score can positively impact affordability, as it indicates a lower risk of default and may result in lower interest rates and more favorable loan terms, such as a 0.5-1.0% reduction in interest rates.
What is the difference between affordability assessment and credit scoring? Affordability assessment evaluates an individual's or household's ability to pay for a product or service, while credit scoring evaluates their creditworthiness and ability to access credit, using different models and frameworks, such as **Altman's Z-score**, which is used to evaluate the creditworthiness of companies.
