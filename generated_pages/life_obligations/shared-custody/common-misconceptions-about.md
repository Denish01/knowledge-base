# Common Misconceptions About Shared Custody

1. INTRODUCTION: Why misconceptions about shared custody are common

Misconceptions about shared custody are common because the concept of shared custody can be complex and often misunderstood. Many people have limited knowledge of the laws and regulations surrounding shared custody, and misinformation can spread quickly. Additionally, the emotional nature of custody battles can lead to misconceptions and myths being perpetuated. It is essential to understand the realities of shared custody to make informed decisions and avoid unnecessary conflicts.

2. MISCONCEPTION LIST: 

- **Myth 1: Shared custody means equal time with both parents**
  - **The Reality:** Shared custody refers to the joint decision-making authority of both parents, not necessarily equal time with both parents. While equal time is possible, it is not always the case.
  - **Why people believe this:** The term "shared custody" can be misleading, leading people to assume it implies equal time with both parents. In reality, the focus is on joint decision-making, not necessarily equal time.

- **Myth 2: Shared custody is only for parents who get along**
  - **The Reality:** Shared custody is not dependent on the parents' relationship. It is possible for parents who do not get along to have a shared custody arrangement, as the focus is on the best interests of the child.
  - **Why people believe this:** The idea that shared custody requires a harmonious relationship between parents is a common misconception. In reality, the court's primary concern is the well-being of the child, not the parents' relationship.

- **Myth 3: Shared custody means no child support**
  - **The Reality:** Child support is determined based on various factors, including income and expenses, and is not directly related to the custody arrangement. Parents with shared custody may still be required to pay child support.
  - **Why people believe this:** The misconception that shared custody eliminates child support may arise from the idea that both parents are equally responsible for the child's care. However, child support is calculated based on individual circumstances, not the custody arrangement.

- **Myth 4: Shared custody gives one parent more control**
  - **The Reality:** Shared custody implies joint decision-making authority, where both parents have an equal say in major decisions affecting the child. One parent does not have more control than the other.
  - **Why people believe this:** The term "shared custody" can lead people to believe that one parent has more authority or control. In reality, the goal of shared custody is to promote cooperation and joint decision-making.

- **Myth 5: Shared custody is not possible if one parent has a history of abuse**
  - **The Reality:** While a history of abuse can be a significant factor in determining custody, it does not automatically preclude shared custody. The court's primary concern is the safety and well-being of the child.
  - **Why people believe this:** The idea that a history of abuse automatically disqualifies a parent from shared custody may arise from the assumption that the court's primary concern is punishing the abusive parent. In reality, the court's focus is on ensuring the child's safety and well-being.

- **Myth 6: Shared custody requires a detailed schedule**
  - **The Reality:** While a schedule can be helpful in shared custody arrangements, it is not always necessary. The key is to establish a flexible and cooperative approach to parenting.
  - **Why people believe this:** The idea that a detailed schedule is required for shared custody may arise from the assumption that structure is essential for co-parenting. In reality, the goal is to promote flexibility and cooperation between parents.

- **Myth 7: Shared custody is only for younger children**
  - **The Reality:** Shared custody can be suitable for children of all ages, as the focus is on the best interests of the child, not their age.
  - **Why people believe this:** The misconception that shared custody is only for younger children may arise from the assumption that older children are more independent and do not require joint decision-making. In reality, the court considers the unique needs and circumstances of each child, regardless of age.

3. HOW TO REMEMBER: 

To avoid these misconceptions, it is essential to understand the fundamental principles of shared custody. Focus on the key aspects, such as joint decision-making authority and the best interests of the child. It is also crucial to consult with a qualified professional, such as a family law attorney, to gain a deeper understanding of the laws and regulations surrounding shared custody. By educating yourself and seeking professional guidance, you can make informed decisions and avoid perpetuating misconceptions.

4. SUMMARY: 

The one thing to remember to avoid confusion about shared custody is that it refers to the joint decision-making authority of both parents, not necessarily equal time or a specific living arrangement. By understanding this fundamental principle, you can avoid common misconceptions and make informed decisions that prioritize the best interests of the child.
