Classification of cohabitation is essential as it helps to understand the diverse forms of shared living, enabling researchers, policymakers, and individuals to identify patterns, challenges, and opportunities associated with each type. By categorizing cohabitation, we can better comprehend the complexities of household dynamics, social relationships, and community structures, ultimately informing decisions that impact individuals, families, and societies.\n\n2. MAIN CATEGORIES\n- **Shacking Up**\n  - Definition: Shacking up, also known as informal cohabitation, refers to a living arrangement where two people, often in a romantic relationship, reside together without being married.\n  - Key characteristics: No formal commitment, shared expenses, and a degree of autonomy.\n  - Example: A couple in their mid-twenties moves in together, sharing a rental apartment and splitting the bills, without any formal marriage plans.\n- **Marital Cohabitation**\n  - Definition: Marital cohabitation refers to a living arrangement where two people are married and reside together, often with a long-term commitment to one another.\n  - Key characteristics: Formal commitment through marriage, shared responsibilities, and often a higher level of interdependence.\n  - Example: A newlywed couple sets up a home together, combining their assets and building a life as a married unit.\n- **Platonic Cohabitation**\n  - Definition: Platonic cohabitation refers to a living arrangement where two or more people, not in a romantic relationship, reside together, often for convenience, financial reasons, or social support.\n  - Key characteristics: No romantic involvement, shared expenses, and a focus on mutual support and companionship.\n  - Example: Two friends, both working professionals, decide to share a house to split the costs and enjoy each other's company.\n- **Intergenerational Cohabitation**\n  - Definition: Intergenerational cohabitation refers to a living arrangement where people of different generations, often family members, reside together, providing support and care for one another.\n  - Key characteristics: Multigenerational household, shared responsibilities, and a focus on caregiving and mutual support.\n  - Example: A grandmother moves in with her adult child and grandchildren, helping with childcare and household chores while receiving emotional support and companionship.\n- **Communal Cohabitation**\n  - Definition: Communal cohabitation refers to a living arrangement where a group of people, often with shared values or goals, reside together, sharing resources and responsibilities.\n  - Key characteristics: Shared living space, collective decision-making, and a focus on community and cooperation.\n  - Example: A group of friends establishes a communal household, sharing meals, chores, and expenses, and working together to maintain a sustainable lifestyle.\n\n3.

HOW THEY RELATE\nThe different types of cohabitation are interconnected, as individuals may transition between categories throughout their lives.
