# Types of Healthcare Directive

**INTRODUCTION**
A healthcare directive is a document that outlines a person's wishes for medical treatment in the event that they become unable to make decisions for themselves. The classification of healthcare directives is important because it helps individuals understand the different types of documents available and choose the one that best suits their needs. By understanding the various types of healthcare directives, individuals can ensure that their medical wishes are respected and that their loved ones are not left with difficult decisions to make. This classification system covers the main categories of healthcare directives, including their definitions, key characteristics, and examples, providing a comprehensive overview of the options available.

**MAIN CATEGORIES**
The following are the main categories of healthcare directives:
1. **Living Will**
   - Definition: A living will is a document that outlines a person's wishes for medical treatment in the event that they become terminally ill or permanently unconscious. It specifies the types of treatment that the person does or does not want to receive.
   - Key characteristics: A living will is typically focused on end-of-life care and is used to guide medical decisions when a person is no longer able to communicate.
   - Example: A person with a terminal illness may create a living will that states they do not want to receive life-sustaining treatment, such as a ventilator or feeding tube, if it will not improve their condition.
2. **Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare**
   - Definition: A durable power of attorney for healthcare is a document that appoints a person to make medical decisions on behalf of the individual if they become unable to make decisions for themselves. This person is often referred to as a healthcare agent or proxy.
   - Key characteristics: A durable power of attorney for healthcare gives the appointed person the authority to make a wide range of medical decisions, including those related to treatment, medication, and hospitalization.
   - Example: A person may appoint their spouse as their healthcare agent, giving them the authority to make medical decisions if they become incapacitated.
3. **Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) Order**
   - Definition: A DNR order is a document that instructs medical personnel not to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) if a person's heart stops or if they stop breathing.
   - Key characteristics: A DNR order is typically used in emergency situations and is often used in conjunction with other healthcare directives.
   - Example: A person with a terminal illness may have a DNR order in place to prevent unnecessary and potentially harmful medical interventions.
4. **Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST)**
   - Definition: A POLST is a document that outlines a person's wishes for medical treatment in the event that they become seriously ill or injured. It is typically used for individuals with serious or life-limiting illnesses.
   - Key characteristics: A POLST is a medical order that is signed by a physician and is used to guide medical decisions in emergency situations.
   - Example: A person with a serious illness may have a POLST that states they do not want to receive life-sustaining treatment, such as a ventilator or feeding tube, if it will not improve their condition.
5. **Mental Health Advance Directive**
   - Definition: A mental health advance directive is a document that outlines a person's wishes for mental health treatment in the event that they become unable to make decisions for themselves.
   - Key characteristics: A mental health advance directive is typically used to guide medical decisions related to mental health treatment, including medication and hospitalization.
   - Example: A person with a mental health condition may create a mental health advance directive that states they do not want to receive certain medications or treatments.
