  "content": "1. INTRODUCTION\nA custodial parent is a parent who has primary physical custody of a child. This means they are responsible for the day-to-day care of the child, including providing a home, food, clothing, and emotional support. Custodial parents can be either mothers or fathers, and in some cases, they may be relatives or guardians.\n\n2. EVERYDAY EXAMPLES\nIn many households, one parent takes on the role of custodial parent. For instance, Sarah, a mother of two, has primary custody of her children, Emily and Jack, after she and her husband divorced. She is responsible for getting them to school on time, helping with homework, and attending parent-teacher conferences. In another example, Mark, a father of one, has custody of his son, Michael, after his wife passed away. Mark works from home to take care of Michael and ensure he gets to school and extracurricular activities on time. Additionally, Rachel and Mike, a divorced couple, share joint custody of their daughter, Olivia, but Rachel is the custodial parent because she has primary physical custody. Olivia lives with Rachel during the school year and spends summers with Mike. In a different scenario, a grandmother, Karen, becomes the custodial parent of her grandson, Alex, after his parents are unable to care for him due to illness.\n\n3. NOTABLE EXAMPLES\nThere are several well-known examples of custodial parents in literature and history. In the classic novel \"To Kill a Mockingbird,\" Atticus Finch is the custodial parent of his children, Scout and Jem, after their mother's death. He takes on the responsibility of raising them and teaching them important life lessons. Another example is the story of Hattie McDaniel, an actress who played Mammy in \"Gone with the Wind.\" She was raised by her grandmother, who was her custodial parent after her parents' divorce. In a real-life example, Angelina Jolie has been a custodial parent to her six children, taking care of their daily needs and making important decisions about their upbringing.\n\n4. EDGE CASES\nIn some cases, a custodial parent may not be a biological parent. For example, a foster parent, such as a woman named Lisa, can become the custodial parent of a child, like a boy named Tyler, who has been removed from his home due to neglect or abuse. Lisa is responsible for providing a safe and nurturing environment for Tyler until he can be reunited with his biological parents or adopted by a permanent family. Another example is a legal guardian, such as a court-appointed guardian, who becomes the custodial parent of a child whose parents are unable to care for them due to illness or incarceration.\n\n5. NON-EXAMPLES\nSome people may think that a non-custodial parent or a parent who has joint custody but does not have primary physical custody is a custodial parent. However, this is not the case. For instance, a father who has visitation rights but does not have primary custody of his child is not a custodial parent. Another example is a parent who has joint custody but lives in a different state than their child and only sees them during vacations. This parent is also not a custodial parent. Additionally, a babysitter or nanny who takes care of a child on a daily basis but does not have legal custody is not a custodial parent.\n\n6. PATTERN\nAll valid examples of custodial parents have one thing in common: they have primary physical custody of a child and are responsible for the day-to-day care and well-being of that child. Whether it is a mother, father, relative, or guardian, the custodial parent is the one who provides a stable and nurturing environment for the child to grow and thrive. This can involve a range of responsibilities, including providing food and shelter, attending to the child's physical and emotional needs, and making important decisions about their upbringing. Regardless of the specific circumstances, the role of a custodial parent is to put the needs of the child first and provide a loving and supportive home.",
