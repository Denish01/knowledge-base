# What is Estimated Tax?

Estimated tax is a method of paying taxes on income that is not subject to withholding, such as self-employment income, interest, dividends, and capital gains.

Estimated tax is a way for individuals to pay taxes on income that is not subject to withholding. When you work for an employer, your employer typically withholds taxes from your paycheck and sends them to the government on your behalf. However, if you have income that is not subject to withholding, such as income from self-employment, investments, or rent, you are responsible for paying taxes on that income throughout the year. This is where estimated tax comes in. Estimated tax allows you to make quarterly payments to the government to cover your tax liability on this type of income.

The purpose of estimated tax is to ensure that you are paying your fair share of taxes throughout the year, rather than all at once when you file your tax return. This helps to avoid a large tax bill when you file your return, as well as potential penalties and interest. To make estimated tax payments, you will need to estimate your tax liability for the year, based on your expected income and expenses. You can use a variety of methods to make estimated tax payments, including online payments, phone payments, and mailing in a check with a payment voucher.

It's worth noting that estimated tax is not just for self-employed individuals. Anyone who has income that is not subject to withholding may need to make estimated tax payments. This can include investors, landlords, and individuals who receive income from a variety of sources. Estimated tax can be a complex topic, but it's an important one to understand if you have income that is not subject to withholding.

The key components of estimated tax include:
* Taxable income: This includes income from self-employment, investments, and other sources that are not subject to withholding.
* Estimated tax payments: These are quarterly payments made to the government to cover your tax liability throughout the year.
* Payment due dates: Estimated tax payments are due on a quarterly basis, with due dates typically falling on April 15th, June 15th, September 15th, and January 15th of the following year.
* Annualized income installment method: This method allows you to annualize your income, taking into account fluctuations in income throughout the year.
* Safe harbor rule: This rule allows you to avoid penalties for underpayment of estimated tax if you meet certain requirements, such as paying either 90% of your current year's tax liability or 100% of your prior year's tax liability.
* Underpayment penalties: These are penalties imposed on individuals who fail to make sufficient estimated tax payments throughout the year.

There are several common misconceptions about estimated tax, including:
* That estimated tax is only for self-employed individuals, when in fact it applies to anyone with income that is not subject to withholding.
* That estimated tax payments are only made annually, when in fact they are typically made on a quarterly basis.
* That estimated tax is a way to avoid paying taxes, when in fact it's a way to ensure that you are paying your fair share of taxes throughout the year.
* That estimated tax is optional, when in fact it's a requirement for individuals with income that is not subject to withholding.

For example, let's say you are a freelance writer who earns $50,000 per year from your writing business. You also earn $10,000 per year in interest from investments. Since your writing income is not subject to withholding, you will need to make estimated tax payments throughout the year to cover your tax liability. You can use Form 1040-ES to make estimated tax payments, and you will need to estimate your tax liability based on your expected income and expenses.

In summary, estimated tax is a method of paying taxes on income that is not subject to withholding, such as self-employment income, interest, dividends, and capital gains, by making quarterly payments to the government to cover your tax liability throughout the year.
