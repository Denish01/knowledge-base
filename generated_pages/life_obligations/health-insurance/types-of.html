<h2>HOW THEY RELATE</h2>
<p>The different types of health insurance are connected in that they provide varying levels of coverage and protection against medical expenses. While some types, such as individual and group health insurance, offer comprehensive coverage, others, like short-term health insurance, provide limited coverage. Medicaid and Medicare are government-sponsored programs that provide coverage to specific populations, while dental and vision insurance plans offer separate coverage for specialized care. Understanding how these types of insurance relate to one another can help individuals and families choose the most suitable coverage for their needs.</p>
