  "content": "1. INTRODUCTION\nEarning capacity refers to the amount of money an individual can potentially earn based on their skills, education, experience, and occupation. It is a measure of one's ability to generate income and is often used to determine financial support, insurance benefits, and career advancement opportunities.\n\n2. EVERYDAY EXAMPLES\nIn daily life, earning capacity can be observed in various scenarios. For instance, a highly skilled software engineer with a degree from a reputable university and several years of experience may have a higher earning capacity than a recent high school graduate working a part-time job. A nurse with specialized training and certifications may have a higher earning capacity than a nurse without such qualifications. Additionally, a small business owner who has invested time and money into developing a unique product or service may have a higher earning capacity than a similar business owner who has not made such investments. A freelance writer with a strong portfolio and established client base may have a higher earning capacity than a new writer just starting out.\n\nConsider the case of John, a 30-year-old accountant with a master's degree and five years of experience. He has a high earning capacity due to his advanced degree and relevant work experience, which enables him to earn a salary of $80,000 per year. In contrast, his friend Emily, a 25-year-old artist with a bachelor's degree and two years of experience, has a lower earning capacity due to the competitive nature of her field and the limited job opportunities available to her. As a result, Emily earns a salary of $40,000 per year.\n\n3. NOTABLE EXAMPLES\nThere are also many well-known examples of earning capacity. For example, professional athletes such as LeBron James or Serena Williams have extremely high earning capacities due to their exceptional skills, fame, and endorsement deals. They can earn tens of millions of dollars per year through a combination of salary, bonuses, and sponsorships. Another example is a successful entrepreneur like Steve Jobs, who co-founded Apple and had a high earning capacity due to his innovative ideas, business acumen, and leadership skills. He was able to generate enormous wealth through the success of his company.\n\n4. EDGE CASES\nIn some cases, earning capacity can be affected by unusual circumstances. For instance, a person with a rare talent or skill, such as a professional chess player or a master puzzle solver, may have a high earning capacity due to their unique abilities. Consider the case of Josh Waitzkin, a chess prodigy who became a world champion at the age of 16. His exceptional skill and fame in the chess world enabled him to earn a significant income through tournament prizes, sponsorships, and book deals.\n\n5. NON-EXAMPLES\nIt's essential to distinguish earning capacity from other concepts that are often confused with it. For example, actual earnings are not the same as earning capacity. A person may have a high earning capacity but choose to work part-time or pursue a lower-paying job for personal reasons. Net worth is also different from earning capacity, as it refers to the total value of one's assets minus liabilities. Additionally, wealth is not the same as earning capacity, as it refers to the accumulation of assets and resources over time, rather than one's potential to generate income.\n\n6. PATTERN\nDespite the variety of examples, all cases of earning capacity share a common pattern. They are all based on an individual's ability to generate income through their skills, experience, and occupation. Whether it's a software engineer, a professional athlete, or a small business owner, earning capacity is determined by the value that an individual can bring to the market and the demand for their skills and services. This pattern highlights the importance of developing valuable skills, gaining relevant experience, and creating opportunities to increase one's earning capacity and achieve financial success. By understanding this pattern, individuals can make informed decisions about their education, career, and personal development to maximize their earning potential.",
