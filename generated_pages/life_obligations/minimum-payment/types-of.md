# What is Types Of Minimum Payment?

1. INTRODUCTION

The concept of minimum payment refers to the smallest amount that must be paid by an individual or organization to fulfill their financial obligations. Classification of minimum payment types is essential as it helps individuals and organizations understand their financial commitments and make informed decisions about their payment schedules. By categorizing minimum payments, individuals can better manage their finances, avoid late fees and penalties, and maintain a good credit score. This classification system covers various types of minimum payments, including those related to credit cards, loans, mortgages, and other financial obligations. Understanding the different types of minimum payments is crucial for effective financial planning and management.

2. MAIN CATEGORIES

The following are the main categories of minimum payment types:
- **Fixed Minimum Payment**
  - Definition: A fixed minimum payment is a predetermined amount that must be paid at regular intervals, usually monthly. This type of payment is often associated with credit cards and loans.
  - Key characteristics: The payment amount remains the same for a specified period, and it may not cover the full interest charged on the outstanding balance.
  - Example: A credit card company may require a fixed minimum payment of $25 per month, regardless of the outstanding balance.
- **Interest-Only Minimum Payment**
  - Definition: An interest-only minimum payment is the minimum amount required to cover the interest charged on an outstanding balance. This type of payment is often associated with mortgages and loans.
  - Key characteristics: The payment amount may vary depending on the interest rate and outstanding balance, and it does not reduce the principal amount borrowed.
  - Example: A mortgage lender may require an interest-only minimum payment of $500 per month, which covers only the interest charged on the outstanding loan balance.
- **Percentage-Based Minimum Payment**
  - Definition: A percentage-based minimum payment is a payment that is calculated as a percentage of the outstanding balance. This type of payment is often associated with credit cards and revolving credit accounts.
  - Key characteristics: The payment amount varies depending on the outstanding balance, and it may be a percentage of the total balance or a percentage of the interest charged.
  - Example: A credit card company may require a minimum payment of 2% of the outstanding balance, which would be $20 if the balance is $1,000.
- **Balloon Minimum Payment**
  - Definition: A balloon minimum payment is a type of payment that requires a larger payment at the end of the payment term. This type of payment is often associated with loans and mortgages.
  - Key characteristics: The payment amount is typically lower than the full payment amount, and a larger payment is required at the end of the term to pay off the outstanding balance.
  - Example: A loan may require a minimum payment of $100 per month for 5 years, with a final balloon payment of $10,000 to pay off the outstanding balance.
