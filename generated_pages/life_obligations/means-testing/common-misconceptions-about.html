<p>Means testing is a process used to determine eligibility for certain benefits or programs based on an individual's or family's income and resources. Despite its importance, many people have misconceptions about means testing. These misconceptions often arise from a lack of understanding of the complex rules and regulations surrounding means testing, as well as misinformation from various sources. As a result, individuals may incorrectly assume they are eligible or ineligible for certain benefits, leading to missed opportunities or unnecessary applications. It is essential to clarify these misconceptions to ensure that people can make informed decisions about their eligibility for benefits.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Myth: Means testing is always based on an individual's circumstances.</li>
