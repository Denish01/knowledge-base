MISCONCEPTION LIST:\n- **Myth: Temporary support is only used in construction.**\n  - **Reality:** Temporary support is used in various fields, including construction, engineering, and social services, to provide assistance during a transitional period.\n  - **Why people believe this:** The term \"temporary support\" is often associated with construction, where it is used to describe scaffolding or other structural support systems.
