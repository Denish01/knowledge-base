  "content": "## Definition\nBeneficiary designation is a legal arrangement where an individual designates a person, trust, or estate to receive the benefits of a particular asset, such as a life insurance policy, retirement account, or annuity, upon their death, originated by the **Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) of 1974**.\n\n## How It Works\nBeneficiary designations are typically made at the time an individual purchases a life insurance policy or opens a retirement account, and they can be changed at any time. The designation is usually made on a form provided by the insurance company or financial institution, and it must be signed and witnessed to be valid. For example, a person may designate their spouse as the primary beneficiary and their children as contingent beneficiaries of their **401(k) plan**, which holds approximately $6.2 trillion in assets (Investment Company Institute). The beneficiary designation overrides any contrary provisions in the individual's will, so it is essential to review and update the designation periodically to ensure that it reflects the individual's current wishes.\n\nThe process of beneficiary designation involves several key steps, including the completion of a beneficiary designation form, which must be signed and witnessed, and the submission of the form to the insurance company or financial institution. The form typically requires the individual to provide the name, address, and social security number of the designated beneficiary, as well as the percentage of the asset that the beneficiary is to receive. For instance, a person may designate their spouse to receive 100% of their **individual retirement account (IRA)**, which can hold up to $6,000 in annual contributions (Internal Revenue Service).\n\nThe use of beneficiary designations can also have significant tax implications, as the benefits received by the beneficiary may be subject to income tax. For example, the **Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017** increased the standard deduction to $12,000 for single filers, which can affect the tax liability of beneficiaries receiving retirement account distributions. To minimize tax liability, individuals may consider designating a trust as the beneficiary of their retirement account, which can provide more flexibility in managing the distribution of assets.\n\n## Key Components\n- **Primary beneficiary**: receives the benefits of the asset upon the death of the individual, and is typically the first in line to receive the benefits.\n- **Contingent beneficiary**: receives the benefits of the asset if the primary beneficiary predeceases the individual, and is typically the second in line to receive the benefits.\n- **Beneficiary designation form**: a document that must be completed and signed by the individual to designate the beneficiary of the asset.\n- **Witness signature**: a signature of a witness, which is required to validate the beneficiary designation form.\n- **Percentage allocation**: the percentage of the asset that each beneficiary is to receive, which can be adjusted by the individual at any time.\n- **Per stirpes**: a method of distribution where the assets are divided among the beneficiaries in a specific manner, such as equally among the children of the individual.\n\n## Common Misconceptions\n**Myth:** Beneficiary designations are only used for life insurance policies \u2014 **Fact:** Beneficiary designations are used for a wide range of assets, including retirement accounts, annuities, and trusts, as evidenced by the **Uniform Trust Code**.\n**Myth:** Beneficiary designations are permanent and cannot be changed \u2014 **Fact:** Beneficiary designations can be changed at any time, as long as the individual is competent and the change is made in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations, such as the **Uniform Probate Code**.\n**Myth:** Beneficiary designations are only used to avoid probate \u2014 **Fact:** Beneficiary designations are used to ensure that the assets are distributed in accordance with the individual's wishes, and to minimize tax liability, as stated in the **Internal Revenue Code**.\n**Myth:** Beneficiary designations are only used for tax planning \u2014 **Fact:** Beneficiary designations are used for a variety of purposes, including estate planning, retirement planning, and asset protection, as outlined in the **American Bar Association's** guidelines for estate planning.\n\n## In Practice\nFor example, John, a 55-year-old employee of **IBM**, has a $500,000 life insurance policy through his employer, and he designates his wife, Mary, as the primary beneficiary and his children, Jane and John Jr., as contingent beneficiaries. If John dies, Mary will receive the entire $500,000, which can be used to pay off the couple's $200,000 mortgage (Freddie Mac). However, if Mary predeceases John, the $500,000 will be divided equally between Jane and John Jr., who can use the funds to pay for their education expenses, such as tuition at **Harvard University**, which costs approximately $53,000 per year (Harvard University).",
