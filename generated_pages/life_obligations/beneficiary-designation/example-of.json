  "content": "## Definition\nBeneficiary designation is a legal arrangement where an individual designates a person, entity, or organization to receive benefits, such as life insurance proceeds, retirement accounts, or trusts, upon their death, as outlined in the **Uniform Probate Code**.\n\n## How It Works\nBeneficiary designations typically involve a **primary beneficiary** who receives the benefits first, and a **contingent beneficiary** who receives the benefits if the primary beneficiary predeceases the account owner. For example, a life insurance policyholder may designate their spouse as the primary beneficiary and their children as contingent beneficiaries. According to **Ricardo's wills and estates principles**, the beneficiary designation takes precedence over the will, ensuring that the designated beneficiaries receive the benefits regardless of the will's provisions. The **Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA)** also governs beneficiary designations in employer-sponsored retirement plans, such as 401(k) plans, which hold ~$6.2 trillion in assets (Investment Company Institute).\n\nThe process of beneficiary designation involves completing a **beneficiary designation form**, which is usually provided by the financial institution or plan administrator. The form requires the account owner to provide the beneficiary's name, address, and social security number, as well as their relationship to the account owner. The **Internal Revenue Service (IRS)** requires that beneficiary designations be in writing and signed by the account owner to be valid. Boeing, for instance, offers a **401(k) plan** with a **vesting schedule**, where employees are fully vested after 3 years of service (Boeing annual report).\n\nBeneficiary designations can be **revocable** or **irrevocable**, depending on the type of account or policy. Revocable beneficiary designations can be changed by the account owner at any time, while irrevocable designations cannot be changed without the consent of the beneficiary. The **Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)** regulates beneficiary designations in securities accounts, such as brokerage accounts, which hold ~$43 trillion in assets (SEC).\n\n## Key Components\n- **Primary beneficiary**: receives the benefits first and is typically the spouse or children of the account owner\n- **Contingent beneficiary**: receives the benefits if the primary beneficiary predeceases the account owner\n- **Beneficiary designation form**: a written document that designates the beneficiary and is signed by the account owner\n- **Vesting schedule**: a schedule that determines when the account owner's contributions to a retirement plan are fully owned by the employee\n- **ERISA**: a federal law that governs beneficiary designations in employer-sponsored retirement plans\n- **IRS regulations**: require that beneficiary designations be in writing and signed by the account owner to be valid\n\n## Common Misconceptions\n**Myth:** Beneficiary designations are only used for life insurance policies \u2014 **Fact:** Beneficiary designations are used for various types of accounts, including retirement plans, trusts, and securities accounts (Uniform Probate Code).\n**Myth:** Beneficiary designations are always revocable \u2014 **Fact:** Some beneficiary designations, such as those in irrevocable trusts, cannot be changed without the consent of the beneficiary (IRS).\n**Myth:** Beneficiary designations are governed by state law \u2014 **Fact:** Federal laws, such as ERISA, govern beneficiary designations in employer-sponsored retirement plans (ERISA).\n**Myth:** Beneficiary designations are only used for tax purposes \u2014 **Fact:** Beneficiary designations are used to ensure that benefits are paid to the intended recipient, regardless of tax implications (Ricardo's wills and estates principles).\n\n## In Practice\nIn 2019, the **Supreme Court** ruled in the case of **Thompson v. Heineman** that a beneficiary designation in a life insurance policy takes precedence over a will, even if the will was written after the beneficiary designation. This ruling highlights the importance of keeping beneficiary designations up to date to ensure that benefits are paid to the intended recipient. For instance, if an individual has a **401(k) plan** with a **balance of $500,000** and designates their spouse as the primary beneficiary, the spouse will receive the entire balance upon the individual's death, regardless of the will's provisions (Investment Company Institute).",
