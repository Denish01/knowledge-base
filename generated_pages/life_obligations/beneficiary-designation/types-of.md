# Types of Beneficiary Designation

There are four primary categories of beneficiary designation, organized by the type of beneficiary and the purpose of the designation. 

## Main Categories
- **Revocable Beneficiary** — a beneficiary designation that can be changed or revoked by the policyholder at any time, distinguishing characteristics include flexibility and control, as seen in the **New York Life Insurance Company**'s policy that allows policyholders to update their beneficiary designations online.
- **Irrevocable Beneficiary** — a beneficiary designation that cannot be changed or revoked by the policyholder without the consent of the beneficiary, distinguishing characteristics include permanence and security, as seen in the **Prudential Financial**'s irrevocable life insurance trusts that provide tax benefits and asset protection.
- **Contingent Beneficiary** — a beneficiary designation that takes effect only if the primary beneficiary predeceases the policyholder, distinguishing characteristics include conditional nature and secondary status, as seen in the **MetLife**'s life insurance policies that allow policyholders to name contingent beneficiaries to ensure that the death benefit is paid to a loved one.
- **Minor Beneficiary** — a beneficiary designation for a minor child or dependent, distinguishing characteristics include age restrictions and guardianship requirements, as seen in the **Guardian Life Insurance Company**'s minor beneficiary riders that provide financial protection for minor children until they reach adulthood.

## Comparison Table
| Category | Flexibility | Security | Cost |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Revocable Beneficiary | High | Low | Low |
| Irrevocable Beneficiary | Low | High | High |
| Contingent Beneficiary | Medium | Medium | Medium |
| Minor Beneficiary | Low | High | Medium |

## How They Relate
The categories of beneficiary designation often overlap or are commonly confused, particularly between **Revocable** and **Irrevocable Beneficiary** designations, which differ primarily in their flexibility and security features. The **Contingent Beneficiary** designation is often used in conjunction with **Revocable** or **Irrevocable Beneficiary** designations to provide a secondary level of protection. The **Minor Beneficiary** designation is a specialized type of beneficiary designation that may be used in conjunction with any of the other categories, depending on the specific needs and circumstances of the policyholder and the minor beneficiary. For example, a policyholder may name a minor child as a **Contingent Beneficiary** and also purchase a **Minor Beneficiary** rider to provide additional financial protection for the child until they reach adulthood.
