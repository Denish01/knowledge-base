# What is Types Of Household Income?

## INTRODUCTION
Household income refers to the total amount of money earned by all members of a household from various sources. Classifying types of household income is essential as it helps individuals, policymakers, and researchers understand the different ways households generate income, make informed decisions, and develop effective policies. A comprehensive classification system enables the identification of patterns, trends, and relationships between different types of income, ultimately contributing to a better understanding of household financial dynamics. By categorizing household income, individuals can also manage their finances more effectively, plan for the future, and make strategic decisions about investments, savings, and expenses.

## MAIN CATEGORIES
The following are the primary types of household income:
1. **Earned Income**
   - Earned income is the money received by household members through their employment, self-employment, or other income-earning activities.
   - Key characteristics: earned through work, taxable, and may be subject to deductions and benefits.
   - Simple example: A person working as a software engineer earns a salary, which is considered earned income.
2. **Unearned Income**
   - Unearned income is the money received by household members without actively working for it, such as through investments, royalties, or government benefits.
   - Key characteristics: not earned through work, may be taxable, and can be a significant source of household income.
   - Simple example: A person receiving dividend payments from their stock investments has unearned income.
3. **Investment Income**
   - Investment income is the money generated from investments, such as stocks, bonds, real estate, or other financial assets.
   - Key characteristics: earned through investments, may be taxable, and can be a source of passive income.
   - Simple example: A household earning interest from a savings account has investment income.
4. **Government Benefits**
   - Government benefits are the money received by household members through government programs, such as social security, unemployment benefits, or other forms of assistance.
   - Key characteristics: provided by the government, may be taxable, and can be a vital source of income for households in need.
   - Simple example: A retired person receiving social security benefits has government benefits as a source of income.
5. **Self-Employment Income**
   - Self-employment income is the money earned by household members through their own businesses, freelancing, or other self-employed activities.
   - Key characteristics: earned through self-employment, taxable, and may be subject to business expenses and deductions.
   - Simple example: A person running their own consulting business earns self-employment income.

## HOW THEY RELATE
The different types of household income are interconnected and can influence one another.

Self-employment income can also be a source of earned income, and unearned income can be used to support household expenses. Understanding the relationships between these categories is crucial for effective household financial management and planning.
