# What is Types Of Support Adjustment?

## INTRODUCTION
Types of support adjustment refer to the various methods and techniques used to modify or adjust support systems, such as foundations, beams, and columns, to ensure stability and safety in structures. Classification of support adjustments is crucial as it helps engineers, architects, and builders to identify the most suitable method for a specific project, taking into account factors such as load-bearing capacity, material properties, and environmental conditions. By understanding the different types of support adjustments, professionals can make informed decisions to ensure the integrity and durability of buildings, bridges, and other structures.

## MAIN CATEGORIES
The following are the main categories of support adjustment:
1. **Foundation Adjustment**
   - Brief definition: Foundation adjustment involves modifying the foundation of a structure to transfer loads to the ground or to improve its stability. This can be done by adding or removing material, or by changing the foundation's configuration.
   - Key characteristics: Foundation adjustments often involve excavating or filling soil, installing new footings or piers, and using specialized equipment to lift or support the structure.
   - Simple example: A house with a sinking foundation may require foundation adjustment to prevent further damage and ensure the structure's stability.
2. **Beam Adjustment**
   - Brief definition: Beam adjustment involves modifying the beams in a structure to improve their load-bearing capacity or to change their configuration. This can be done by adding or removing material, or by changing the beam's shape or size.
   - Key characteristics: Beam adjustments often involve welding or bolting new sections to the existing beam, or using specialized equipment to lift or support the beam.
   - Simple example: A bridge with a damaged beam may require beam adjustment to restore its structural integrity and ensure safe passage.
3. **Column Adjustment**
   - Brief definition: Column adjustment involves modifying the columns in a structure to improve their load-bearing capacity or to change their configuration. This can be done by adding or removing material, or by changing the column's shape or size.
   - Key characteristics: Column adjustments often involve installing new column sections, or using specialized equipment to lift or support the column.
   - Simple example: A building with a damaged column may require column adjustment to prevent collapse and ensure the structure's stability.
4. **Shoring Adjustment**
   - Brief definition: Shoring adjustment involves using temporary support systems to hold a structure in place while repairs or modifications are made. This can be done using scaffolding, props, or other specialized equipment.
   - Key characteristics: Shoring adjustments often involve installing temporary support systems to hold the structure in place, and then removing them once the repairs or modifications are complete.
   - Simple example: A building with a damaged wall may require shoring adjustment to support the structure while repairs are made.
5. **Reshoring Adjustment**
   - Brief definition: Reshoring adjustment involves reconfiguring or modifying an existing shoring system to improve its stability or to change its configuration. This can be done by adding or removing material, or by changing the shoring system's shape or size.
   - Key characteristics: Reshoring adjustments often involve installing new shoring sections, or using specialized equipment to lift or support the shoring system.
   - Simple example: A construction site with a shoring system that is no longer stable may require reshoring adjustment to ensure the structure's safety and integrity.

## COMPARISON TABLE
The following table summarizes the differences between the main categories of support adjustment:
| Category | Brief Definition | Key Characteristics | Simple Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Foundation Adjustment | Modifying the foundation | Excavating or filling soil, installing new footings or piers | House with a sinking foundation |
| Beam Adjustment | Modifying the beams | Welding or bolting new sections, using specialized equipment | Bridge with a damaged beam |
| Column Adjustment | Modifying the columns | Installing new column sections, using specialized equipment | Building with a damaged column |
| Shoring Adjustment | Using temporary support systems | Installing temporary support systems, removing them once complete | Building with a damaged wall |
| Reshoring Adjustment | Reconfiguring or modifying an existing shoring system | Installing new shoring sections, using specialized equipment | Construction site with an unstable shoring system |

## HOW THEY RELATE
The categories of support adjustment are interconnected and often overlap. For example, foundation adjustment may involve beam or column adjustment, while shoring adjustment may be used in conjunction with foundation, beam, or column adjustment. Understanding the relationships between these categories is crucial for professionals to make informed decisions and ensure the integrity and safety of structures.

## SUMMARY
The classification system of support adjustment includes foundation adjustment, beam adjustment, column adjustment, shoring adjustment, and reshoring adjustment, each with its unique characteristics and applications, which are essential for ensuring the stability and safety of structures.
