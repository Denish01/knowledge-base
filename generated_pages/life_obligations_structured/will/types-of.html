<p>HOW THEY RELATE</p>
<p>The different types of wills are connected in that they all serve the purpose of outlining an individual's wishes regarding the distribution of their assets and property after their passing. However, they differ in their specific purposes, characteristics, and uses. For example, a simple will and a joint will are both used to distribute assets, but a joint will is typically used by spouses, while a simple will can be used by anyone. A living will, on the other hand, focuses on medical treatment and end-of-life care, while a pour-over will is used to transfer assets to a trust. Understanding how these types of wills relate and differ is essential in choosing the right type of will for an individual's specific needs and circumstances.</p>

<p>SUMMARY</p>
<p>The classification system of wills includes various types, such as simple wills, joint wills, living wills, pour-over wills, and holographic wills, each serving a unique purpose and having distinct characteristics that cater to different individual needs and circumstances.</p>
