# What is Types Of Cohabitation?

1. INTRODUCTION
Types of cohabitation refer to the various ways in which people live together in a shared household, encompassing different relationships, arrangements, and lifestyles. Classification of cohabitation is essential as it helps to understand the diverse forms of shared living, enabling researchers, policymakers, and individuals to identify patterns, challenges, and opportunities associated with each type. By categorizing cohabitation, we can better comprehend the complexities of household dynamics, social relationships, and community structures, ultimately informing decisions that impact individuals, families, and societies.
