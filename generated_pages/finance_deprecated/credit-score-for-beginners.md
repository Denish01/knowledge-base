Lenders use this score to decide if they should give you a loan or credit card. A good credit score can help you get loans and credit cards with good interest rates. A bad credit score can make it hard to get loans or credit cards.

You can get a free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit reporting companies once a year. Look for any mistakes or wrong information and fix them. You should also start paying your bills on time, every time. This will help you build a good credit score over time.
