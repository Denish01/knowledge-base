FIRST STEPS: The first thing to do is to think about what you want to achieve with your investments. Do you want to save for a big purchase, like a house, or for retirement? Knowing your goals will help you decide how to allocate your assets. You should also think about how much risk you are willing to take. If you are afraid of losing money, you might want to choose safer investments.\n\n5.
