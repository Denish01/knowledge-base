INTRODUCTION\nA Roth Individual Retirement Account, commonly referred to as a Roth IRA, is a type of savings account that allows individuals to set aside money for retirement while providing certain tax benefits. The general purpose of a Roth IRA is to provide a means for individuals to save for their retirement years, offering a way to grow their savings over time and withdraw the funds tax-free in retirement.\n\n2. PRIMARY USES\nThe primary uses of a Roth IRA include:\n- Saving for retirement: A Roth IRA is designed to help individuals accumulate wealth over time, providing a source of income in retirement. For example, an individual may contribute a portion of their income to a Roth IRA each year, allowing the funds to grow and compound over time.\n- Tax-free growth: Contributions to a Roth IRA are made with after-tax dollars, meaning that the funds have already been taxed. As a result, the money in the account grows tax-free, and the individual will not have to pay taxes on the investment earnings.\n- First-time home purchase: Roth IRA funds can be used to help individuals purchase their first home. For instance, a person may withdraw up to a certain amount from their Roth IRA to use as a down payment on a home, without incurring penalties or taxes.\n- Education expenses: Some individuals may use Roth IRA funds to pay for qualified education expenses, such as college tuition or other higher education costs. This can be a useful option for those who need to access their retirement savings for educational purposes.\n\n3.

This can be a useful option for those who need to access their retirement savings for medical purposes.\n- Inheritance: Roth IRAs can be passed down to beneficiaries, providing a tax-free source of income for heirs. This can be an attractive option for individuals looking to leave a legacy for their loved ones.\n\n4.
