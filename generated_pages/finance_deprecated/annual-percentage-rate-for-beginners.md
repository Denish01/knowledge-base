# What is Annual Percentage Rate For Beginners?

1. WHAT YOU'LL LEARN: This guide will help you understand what an annual percentage rate (APR) is and how it affects borrowing money. By the end of this guide, you will be able to make informed decisions when dealing with loans and credit.

2. THE BASICS: An annual percentage rate is a way to measure how much it costs to borrow money. It is like the price tag on a loan. When you borrow money, you have to pay back the amount you borrowed plus some extra money, which is the interest. The APR tells you how much interest you will pay each year.

3. KEY TERMS: 
- Interest: the extra money you pay when you borrow
- Loan: when someone gives you money and you promise to pay it back
- Credit: the ability to borrow money
- Borrower: the person who gets the money
- Lender: the person or company that gives the money
- Principal: the original amount of money borrowed

4. FIRST STEPS: The first thing you should do is understand that APR is not the same as the interest rate. The interest rate is the monthly or daily rate, but the APR is the rate for the whole year. When you are borrowing money, you should always look for the APR to know the total cost of the loan. You should also know that a lower APR is usually better because it means you will pay less interest.

5. COMMON BEGINNER MISTAKES: 
- Not checking the APR before borrowing money
- Not understanding the difference between APR and interest rate
- Not considering the total cost of the loan, including fees
- Thinking that a low monthly payment means a good loan, without checking the APR

6. NEXT STEPS: After you understand the basics of APR, you should learn about different types of loans and credit, such as credit cards, mortgages, and personal loans. You should also learn how to compare APRs and how to choose the best loan for your needs. Additionally, you should learn about how to manage your debt and how to avoid paying too much interest. With this knowledge, you will be able to make smart financial decisions and avoid costly mistakes. Remember, understanding APR is an important step in taking control of your finances.
