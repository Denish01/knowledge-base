<h2>HOW THEY RELATE</h2>
<p>The stages of a 401k retirement plan are interconnected and build upon one another. Each stage represents a critical aspect of the retirement planning process, from eligibility and enrollment to distribution and retirement. Understanding how these stages relate to one another is essential for creating a comprehensive retirement strategy. For example, the contributions and investments made during the early stages of the plan will impact the vesting and ownership of the account, which in turn will affect the loan and withdrawal options available. Ultimately, the goal of each stage is to support the final stage of distribution and retirement, where the retiree can enjoy the fruits of their labor and manage their retirement income effectively.</p>
