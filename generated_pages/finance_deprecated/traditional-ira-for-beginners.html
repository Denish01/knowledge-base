        <p>1. WHAT YOU'LL LEARN:</p>
<p>This guide will help you understand what a traditional IRA is and how it works. You will learn the basics of traditional IRAs, key terms, and steps to get started.</p>

<p>2. THE BASICS:</p>
<p>A traditional IRA, or Individual Retirement Account, is a way to save money for when you retire. You put money into the account, and it grows over time. The money is taxed when you take it out, but it can help you have a more comfortable retirement.</p>

<p>3. KEY TERMS:</p>
<p>Here are some important words to know:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Contribution: The money you put into your IRA each year.</li>
  <li>Deduction: When you put money into a traditional IRA, you may not have to pay taxes on that money right away. This is called a tax deduction.</li>
  <li>Retirement: The time in your life when you stop working and live on the money you saved.</li>
  <li>Tax-deferred: This means you do not pay taxes on the money in your IRA until you take it out.</li>
  <li>Withdrawal: When you take money out of your IRA.</li>
</ul>

<p>4. FIRST STEPS:</p>
<p>To get started, you need to understand your income and how much you can contribute to a traditional IRA. You should also think about how much you want to save for retirement. It is a good idea to talk to a financial advisor or do some research to figure out what is best for you.</p>

<p>5. COMMON BEGINNER MISTAKES:</p>
<p>Some common mistakes people make when starting a traditional IRA include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Not understanding the rules about how much you can contribute each year.</li>
  <li>Not thinking about how you will use the money in your IRA when you retire.</li>
  <li>Putting all your retirement savings into one type of account, like a traditional IRA.</li>
  <li>Not starting to save for retirement early enough.</li>
</ul>

<p>6. NEXT STEPS:</p>
<p>Once you understand the basics of traditional IRAs, you can learn more about other types of retirement accounts, like Roth IRAs. You can also learn about different ways to invest the money in your IRA, such as stocks or bonds. It is also a good idea to make a plan for how you will use the money in your IRA when you retire.
