# What is Parts Of Asset Allocation?

1. INTRODUCTION:
Asset allocation is a crucial aspect of investment planning, as it involves dividing a portfolio among different asset classes to achieve a desired balance between risk and return. The parts of asset allocation cover various components that investors use to create a diversified portfolio, including different types of assets, investment strategies, and risk management techniques. Classification of these parts matters because it helps investors understand the role of each component, make informed decisions, and ultimately achieve their investment goals. By categorizing the different parts of asset allocation, investors can better navigate the complex world of investing and create a portfolio that aligns with their objectives and risk tolerance.

2. MAIN CATEGORIES:
- **Strategic Asset Allocation**
  - Definition: Strategic asset allocation involves setting a long-term target mix of assets based on an investor's risk tolerance, investment horizon, and financial goals. This approach focuses on maintaining a consistent asset allocation over time, with periodic rebalancing to ensure the portfolio remains aligned with the target mix.
  - Key characteristics: Long-term focus, target mix of assets, periodic rebalancing
  - Example: An investor with a moderate risk tolerance and a long-term investment horizon might allocate 60% of their portfolio to stocks and 40% to bonds, with regular rebalancing to maintain this target mix.
- **Tactical Asset Allocation**
  - Definition: Tactical asset allocation involves making short-term adjustments to a portfolio's asset mix in response to changes in market conditions or economic outlook. This approach seeks to capitalize on potential opportunities or mitigate potential risks by temporarily deviating from the strategic asset allocation.
  - Key characteristics: Short-term focus, active management, flexibility
  - Example: In response to a sudden change in interest rates, an investor might temporarily shift a portion of their portfolio from bonds to stocks to take advantage of the potential increase in stock prices.
- **Dynamic Asset Allocation**
  - Definition: Dynamic asset allocation involves continuously adjusting a portfolio's asset mix in response to changes in market conditions, economic outlook, or investor circumstances. This approach seeks to optimize the portfolio's return and risk profile by actively managing the asset allocation.
  - Key characteristics: Continuous monitoring, active management, adaptability
  - Example: An investor might use a dynamic asset allocation approach to adjust their portfolio's mix of stocks and bonds in response to changes in their risk tolerance, investment horizon, or financial goals.
- **Core-Satellite Asset Allocation**
  - Definition: Core-satellite asset allocation involves dividing a portfolio into a core component, which represents the majority of the portfolio and is invested in a diversified mix of assets, and satellite components, which represent smaller portions of the portfolio and are invested in specialized or higher-risk assets.
  - Key characteristics: Core component, satellite components, diversification
  - Example: An investor might allocate 80% of their portfolio to a core component, consisting of a diversified mix of stocks and bonds, and 20% to satellite components, consisting of specialized investments such as real estate or commodities.
- **Risk Parity Asset Allocation**
  - Definition: Risk parity asset allocation involves allocating a portfolio's assets based on their risk contribution, rather than their market value. This approach seeks to balance the risk of each asset class, rather than the dollar amount invested in each asset class.
  - Key characteristics: Risk-based allocation, balance of risk
  - Example: An investor might allocate their portfolio to achieve a risk parity among different asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, and commodities, by adjusting the allocation based on the risk contribution of each asset class.

3. COMPARISON TABLE:
| Category | Focus | Time Horizon | Management Style |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Strategic Asset Allocation | Long-term | Long-term | Passive |
| Tactical Asset Allocation | Short-term | Short-term | Active |
| Dynamic Asset Allocation | Continuous | Variable | Active |
| Core-Satellite Asset Allocation | Diversification | Long-term | Hybrid |
| Risk Parity Asset Allocation | Risk-based | Variable | Active |

4. HOW THEY RELATE:
The different parts of asset allocation are interconnected and can be used in combination to create a comprehensive investment strategy. For example, an investor might use strategic asset allocation to set a long-term target mix of assets, while also using tactical asset allocation to make short-term adjustments in response to changes in market conditions. Similarly, an investor might use core-satellite asset allocation to divide their portfolio into core and satellite components, while also using risk parity asset allocation to balance the risk of each asset class. By understanding the relationships between these different parts, investors can create a portfolio that is tailored to their unique needs and goals.

5. SUMMARY:
The classification system for the parts of asset allocation includes strategic, tactical, dynamic, core-satellite, and risk parity asset allocation, each with its own unique characteristics and applications, which can be used individually or in combination to create a comprehensive investment strategy.
