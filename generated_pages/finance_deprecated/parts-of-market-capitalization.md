# What is Parts Of Market Capitalization?

INTRODUCTION
Market capitalization is a crucial concept in finance that refers to the total value of a company's outstanding shares. Understanding the different parts of market capitalization is essential for investors, analysts, and businesses to make informed decisions. Classification of market capitalization into various categories helps to identify the size and scope of a company, which can impact its investment potential, risk profile, and growth prospects. By categorizing companies based on their market capitalization, investors can better understand the characteristics of each group and make more informed investment decisions. This classification system also enables companies to understand their position within the market and make strategic decisions to drive growth and expansion.

MAIN CATEGORIES
The main categories of market capitalization are:
- **Large Cap**: Large cap companies have a market capitalization of $10 billion or more. These companies are typically well-established, financially stable, and have a strong track record of performance. Key characteristics include high market liquidity, low volatility, and a large market share. For example, a company like Apple or Microsoft would be considered a large cap company due to its significant market capitalization and stable financial performance.
- **Mid Cap**: Mid cap companies have a market capitalization between $2 billion and $10 billion. These companies are often in a growth phase, with expanding product lines, increasing revenue, and improving profitability. Key characteristics include moderate market liquidity, moderate volatility, and a growing market share. For example, a company like Whirlpool or Harley-Davidson would be considered a mid cap company due to its moderate market capitalization and growth prospects.
- **Small Cap**: Small cap companies have a market capitalization between $300 million and $2 billion. These companies are often in the early stages of development, with limited product lines, low revenue, and high volatility. Key characteristics include low market liquidity, high volatility, and a small market share. For example, a company like a startup or a regional business would be considered a small cap company due to its limited market capitalization and high growth potential.
- **Micro Cap**: Micro cap companies have a market capitalization between $50 million and $300 million. These companies are often in the early stages of development, with limited resources, high risk, and high potential for growth. Key characteristics include very low market liquidity, high volatility, and a very small market share. For example, a company like a small startup or a niche business would be considered a micro cap company due to its very limited market capitalization and high risk profile.
- **Nano Cap**: Nano cap companies have a market capitalization below $50 million. These companies are often in the very early stages of development, with minimal resources, extremely high risk, and extremely high potential for growth. Key characteristics include extremely low market liquidity, extremely high volatility, and a negligible market share. For example, a company like a newly formed startup or a tiny business would be considered a nano cap company due to its extremely limited market capitalization and extremely high risk profile.

COMPARISON TABLE
The following table summarizes the key differences between the main categories of market capitalization:
| Category | Market Capitalization | Market Liquidity | Volatility | Market Share |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Large Cap | $10 billion+ | High | Low | Large |
| Mid Cap | $2 billion-$10 billion | Moderate | Moderate | Growing |
| Small Cap | $300 million-$2 billion | Low | High | Small |
| Micro Cap | $50 million-$300 million | Very Low | High | Very Small |
| Nano Cap | Below $50 million | Extremely Low | Extremely High | Negligible |

HOW THEY RELATE
The different categories of market capitalization are interconnected, with companies often progressing from one category to another as they grow and develop. For example, a small cap company may become a mid cap company as it expands its product lines and increases its revenue. Similarly, a mid cap company may become a large cap company as it becomes more established and financially stable. Understanding the relationships between these categories is essential for investors and companies to make informed decisions and drive growth and expansion.

SUMMARY
The classification system of market capitalization consists of five main categories - large cap, mid cap, small cap, micro cap, and nano cap - each with distinct characteristics, such as market liquidity, volatility, and market share, which help investors and companies understand the size and scope of a company and make informed decisions.
