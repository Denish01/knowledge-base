1. INTRODUCTION:
Mortgage amortization is a financial concept used to calculate the amount of money borrowed to purchase a property, and the process of gradually paying off the debt over time. The general purpose of mortgage amortization is to provide a clear understanding of the total cost of a loan, including the interest paid over the life of the loan. This concept is essential for individuals, businesses, and financial institutions to make informed decisions about borrowing and lending.

2. PRIMARY USES:

For example, a homeowner who borrows $200,000 to purchase a house can use mortgage amortization to calculate their monthly payments, determine the total cost of the loan, and compare different loan options. This information can help the homeowner make informed decisions about their mortgage and ensure they can afford the monthly payments.
