It is connected to other tax concepts, such as income tax and wealth tax, and plays a role in shaping fiscal policies and budget decisions. Understanding capital gains tax is essential for grasping the broader context of personal finance, business, and economics. It is also linked to social and economic goals, such as promoting economic growth, reducing income inequality, and funding public services.</p>
