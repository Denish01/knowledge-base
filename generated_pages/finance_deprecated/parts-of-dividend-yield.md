# What is Parts Of Dividend Yield?

INTRODUCTION
The dividend yield is a crucial concept in finance that represents the ratio of annual dividend payments to the stock's current price. Understanding the different parts of dividend yield is essential for investors to make informed decisions. Classification of these parts is vital as it helps in identifying the various components that contribute to the overall dividend yield, enabling investors to analyze and compare different investment opportunities. By breaking down the dividend yield into its constituent parts, investors can gain a deeper understanding of the underlying factors that affect the yield, ultimately leading to more effective investment strategies.

MAIN CATEGORIES
The following are the main categories that make up the parts of dividend yield:
- **Dividend Per Share**: This refers to the amount of dividend paid per share of stock, usually expressed in dollars. Key characteristics include the frequency of payment, such as quarterly or annually, and the amount of dividend paid per share. For example, if a company pays an annual dividend of $2 per share, the dividend per share would be $2.
- **Current Stock Price**: This is the current market price of the stock, which is used as the denominator in calculating the dividend yield. Key characteristics include the stock's market capitalization, trading volume, and price volatility. For instance, if the current stock price is $50, this value would be used to calculate the dividend yield.
- **Annual Dividend Payment**: This represents the total amount of dividend paid by the company over a year, usually expressed in dollars. Key characteristics include the dividend payout ratio, dividend frequency, and dividend growth rate. For example, if a company pays a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share, the annual dividend payment would be $2 per share.
- **Dividend Payout Ratio**: This is the ratio of the annual dividend payment to the company's earnings per share, usually expressed as a percentage. Key characteristics include the company's profitability, cash flow, and dividend policy. For instance, if a company earns $5 per share and pays an annual dividend of $2 per share, the dividend payout ratio would be 40%.
- **Earnings Per Share**: This represents the company's net income per share, usually expressed in dollars. Key characteristics include the company's revenue, operating expenses, and tax rate. For example, if a company earns $100 million in net income and has 20 million shares outstanding, the earnings per share would be $5.

COMPARISON TABLE
The following table summarizes the differences between the categories:
| Category | Definition | Key Characteristics | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dividend Per Share | Amount of dividend paid per share | Frequency of payment, amount of dividend paid per share | $2 per share |
| Current Stock Price | Current market price of the stock | Market capitalization, trading volume, price volatility | $50 per share |
| Annual Dividend Payment | Total amount of dividend paid over a year | Dividend payout ratio, dividend frequency, dividend growth rate | $2 per share |
| Dividend Payout Ratio | Ratio of annual dividend payment to earnings per share | Company profitability, cash flow, dividend policy | 40% |
| Earnings Per Share | Company's net income per share | Revenue, operating expenses, tax rate | $5 per share |

HOW THEY RELATE
The categories are interconnected and affect each other in various ways. For instance, the dividend per share and annual dividend payment are directly related, as the annual dividend payment is the total amount of dividend paid per share over a year. The current stock price affects the dividend yield, as a higher stock price would result in a lower dividend yield, and vice versa. The dividend payout ratio is influenced by the company's earnings per share, as a higher earnings per share would allow the company to pay a higher dividend. Understanding these relationships is essential for investors to make informed decisions and analyze the different components of the dividend yield.

SUMMARY
The classification system of dividend yield consists of five main categories: dividend per share, current stock price, annual dividend payment, dividend payout ratio, and earnings per share, which are interconnected and affect each other in various ways.
