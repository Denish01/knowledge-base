# What is Parts Of Amortization Schedule?

1. INTRODUCTION:
An amortization schedule is a table that outlines the periodic payments made on a loan, showing the amount of interest and principal paid with each payment. The parts of an amortization schedule are crucial in understanding how loans work and how they are paid off over time. Classification of these parts is essential as it helps borrowers and lenders alike to comprehend the loan's structure, make informed decisions, and manage their finances effectively. By categorizing the different components of an amortization schedule, individuals can better navigate the complexities of loan repayment and make sense of the various calculations involved.

2. MAIN CATEGORIES:
- **Initial Loan Amount**
  - Definition: The initial loan amount, also known as the principal, is the total amount borrowed from the lender. It serves as the basis for calculating the interest and monthly payments.
  - Key characteristics: The initial loan amount is the starting point for the amortization schedule and determines the total interest paid over the life of the loan.
  - Example: If a borrower takes out a $100,000 mortgage, the initial loan amount is $100,000.
- **Monthly Payment**
  - Definition: The monthly payment, also known as the installment, is the fixed amount paid by the borrower each month to pay off the loan. It typically includes both interest and principal components.
  - Key characteristics: The monthly payment is calculated based on the initial loan amount, interest rate, and loan term, and remains constant throughout the loan period.
  - Example: A borrower with a $100,000 mortgage and a 30-year loan term may have a monthly payment of $500.
- **Interest Paid**
  - Definition: The interest paid is the amount of interest accrued on the outstanding loan balance each month. It is a component of the monthly payment and is calculated based on the interest rate and outstanding balance.
  - Key characteristics: The interest paid decreases over time as the loan balance decreases, while the principal paid increases.
  - Example: In the first month of a $100,000 mortgage with a 5% interest rate, the interest paid might be $416.67.
- **Principal Paid**
  - Definition: The principal paid is the amount of the monthly payment that goes towards reducing the outstanding loan balance. It increases over time as the loan balance decreases.
  - Key characteristics: The principal paid is the portion of the monthly payment that actually reduces the loan balance and builds equity.
  - Example: In the first month of a $100,000 mortgage, the principal paid might be $83.33.
- **Outstanding Balance**
  - Definition: The outstanding balance, also known as the remaining balance, is the amount of the loan that still needs to be paid off after each monthly payment. It decreases over time as the principal is paid off.
  - Key characteristics: The outstanding balance is the amount of the loan that remains after each payment and is used to calculate the interest for the next period.
  - Example: After the first month of a $100,000 mortgage, the outstanding balance might be $99,916.67.
- **Total Interest Paid**
  - Definition: The total interest paid is the cumulative amount of interest paid over the life of the loan. It is calculated by summing up the interest paid each month.
  - Key characteristics: The total interest paid increases over time and is affected by the interest rate, loan term, and monthly payment.
  - Example: Over the life of a 30-year $100,000 mortgage with a 5% interest rate, the total interest paid might be $93,429.49.

3. COMPARISON TABLE:
The following table summarizes the main categories of an amortization schedule:
| Category | Definition | Key Characteristics | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Initial Loan Amount | Total amount borrowed | Basis for calculations | $100,000 |
| Monthly Payment | Fixed amount paid each month | Calculated based on loan terms | $500 |
| Interest Paid | Interest accrued each month | Decreases over time | $416.67 |
| Principal Paid | Amount reducing loan balance | Increases over time | $83.33 |
| Outstanding Balance | Remaining loan balance | Decreases over time | $99,916.67 |
| Total Interest Paid | Cumulative interest paid | Increases over time | $93,429.49 |

4. HOW THEY RELATE:
The categories of an amortization schedule are interconnected and influence one another. The initial loan amount and interest rate determine the monthly payment, which in turn affects the interest paid and principal paid each month. As the principal is paid off, the outstanding balance decreases, and the interest paid also decreases. The total interest paid is the cumulative result of the interest paid each month, and it is affected by the loan term, interest rate, and monthly payment. Understanding how these categories relate is essential for managing loan repayment and making informed financial decisions.

5. SUMMARY:
The classification system of an amortization schedule consists of six main categories: initial loan amount, monthly payment, interest paid, principal paid, outstanding balance, and total interest paid, which are all interconnected and influence one another to provide a comprehensive understanding of loan repayment.
