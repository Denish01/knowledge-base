1. WHAT YOU'LL LEARN: This guide will teach you about dividend yield, a way to measure how much money you can make from owning shares of a company. By the end of this guide, you will understand the basics of dividend yield and how to get started with investing.

2. THE BASICS: Dividend yield is a simple idea. When you own shares of a company, you can get paid a part of the company's profits. This payment is called a dividend. The dividend yield is like a report card for the dividend. It shows how much money you get from the dividend compared to the price you paid for the share. For example, if you buy a share for $100 and get $5 in dividends, the dividend yield is 5%.

3. KEY TERMS: Here are some important words to know when talking about dividend yield:
- Dividend: a payment made by a company to its shareholders.
- Share: a small part of a company that you can own.

- Profit: the money a company makes after paying its expenses.

4. FIRST STEPS: To start understanding dividend yield, you need to know what shares are and how they work. You should also learn about the different types of companies that pay dividends. Some companies pay dividends regularly, while others do not pay dividends at all. It's essential to research and understand the company before investing in its shares.
