# What is Parts Of Credit Score?

1. INTRODUCTION:
The parts of a credit score refer to the various components that make up an individual's overall creditworthiness. Understanding these components is crucial as it helps individuals identify areas for improvement and make informed financial decisions. Classification of these parts matters because it allows individuals to recognize the distinct characteristics of each component and how they contribute to the overall credit score. By recognizing these components, individuals can take targeted steps to improve their credit score, which can have a significant impact on their ability to secure loans, credit cards, and other financial services.

2. MAIN CATEGORIES:
The main categories that make up a credit score include:
- **Payment History**: This component refers to an individual's track record of making on-time payments, late payments, and accounts sent to collections. Key characteristics include payment frequency, payment amount, and the presence of any late or missed payments. For example, if an individual has a history of making all their credit card payments on time, this would positively impact their payment history.
- **Credit Utilization**: This component refers to the amount of credit being used compared to the amount of credit available. Key characteristics include the credit utilization ratio, credit limit, and the presence of any maxed-out credit accounts. For example, if an individual has a credit card with a $1,000 limit and a balance of $300, their credit utilization ratio would be 30%.
- **Length of Credit History**: This component refers to the length of time an individual has been using credit. Key characteristics include the age of the oldest account, the average age of all accounts, and the presence of any new accounts. For example, if an individual has been using credit for 10 years, this would positively impact their length of credit history.
- **Credit Mix**: This component refers to the variety of credit types an individual has, such as credit cards, loans, and mortgages. Key characteristics include the presence of different credit types, the number of accounts, and the credit limit of each account. For example, if an individual has a credit card, a car loan, and a mortgage, this would demonstrate a diverse credit mix.
- **New Credit**: This component refers to new credit inquiries and accounts. Key characteristics include the number of new accounts, the number of credit inquiries, and the presence of any new credit accounts. For example, if an individual has recently applied for multiple credit cards, this would negatively impact their new credit score.

3. COMPARISON TABLE:
The following table summarizes the differences between the main categories:
| Category | Definition | Key Characteristics | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Payment History | Track record of payments | Payment frequency, payment amount, late payments | On-time credit card payments |
| Credit Utilization | Amount of credit used | Credit utilization ratio, credit limit, maxed-out accounts | $300 balance on a $1,000 credit card |
| Length of Credit History | Length of time using credit | Age of oldest account, average age of accounts, new accounts | 10 years of credit history |
| Credit Mix | Variety of credit types | Presence of different credit types, number of accounts, credit limit | Credit card, car loan, mortgage |
| New Credit | New credit inquiries and accounts | Number of new accounts, credit inquiries, new credit accounts | Multiple new credit card applications |

4. HOW THEY RELATE:
The categories that make up a credit score are interconnected and can impact one another. For example, a high credit utilization ratio can negatively impact an individual's payment history if they are unable to make payments on time. Similarly, a long length of credit history can positively impact an individual's credit mix if they have a diverse range of credit types. Understanding how these categories relate to one another is crucial in maintaining a healthy credit score.

5. SUMMARY:
The classification system for the parts of a credit score includes five main categories: payment history, credit utilization, length of credit history, credit mix, and new credit, which all work together to provide a comprehensive picture of an individual's creditworthiness.
