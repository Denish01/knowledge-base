- Tax-deferred: This means you do not pay taxes on the money in your IRA until you take it out.
- Withdrawal: When you take money out of your IRA.

4. FIRST STEPS: 
To get started, you need to understand your income and how much you can contribute to a traditional IRA. You should also think about how much you want to save for retirement. It is a good idea to talk to a financial advisor or do some research to figure out what is best for you.
