        <p>1. INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>A Roth Individual Retirement Account, commonly referred to as a Roth IRA, is a type of savings account that allows individuals to set aside money for retirement while providing certain tax benefits. The general purpose of a Roth IRA is to provide a means for individuals to save for their retirement years, offering a way to grow their savings over time and withdraw the funds tax-free in retirement.</p>

<p>2. PRIMARY USES</p>
<p>The primary uses of a Roth IRA include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Saving for retirement: A Roth IRA is designed to help individuals accumulate wealth over time, providing a source of income in retirement. For example, an individual may contribute a portion of their income to a Roth IRA each year, allowing the funds to grow and compound over time.</li>
  <li>Tax-free growth: Contributions to a Roth IRA are made with after-tax dollars, meaning that the funds have already been taxed. As a result, the money in the account grows tax-free, and the individual will not have to pay taxes on the investment earnings.</li>
  <li>First-time home purchase: Roth IRA funds can be used to help individuals purchase their first home. For instance, a person may withdraw up to a certain amount from their Roth IRA to use as a down payment on a home, without incurring penalties or taxes.</li>
  <li>Education expenses: Some individuals may use Roth IRA funds to pay for qualified education expenses, such as college tuition or other higher education costs. This can be a useful option for those who need to access their retirement savings for educational purposes.</li>
</ul>

<p>3. SECONDARY USES</p>
<p>In addition to the primary uses, Roth IRAs also have some secondary uses, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Disability or unemployment: In certain circumstances, individuals may be able to withdraw funds from a Roth IRA without penalty if they become disabled or experience a period of unemployment. This can provide a vital source of income during difficult times.</li>
  <li>Medical expenses: Some individuals may use Roth IRA funds to pay for qualified medical expenses, such as hospital bills or other healthcare costs. This can be a useful option for those who need to access their retirement savings for medical purposes.</li>
  <li>Inheritance: Roth IRAs can be passed down to beneficiaries, providing a tax-free source of income for heirs. This can be an attractive option for individuals looking to leave a legacy for their loved ones.</li>
</ul>

<p>4. WHO USES IT</p>
<p>Roth IRAs are commonly used by individuals who are planning for retirement, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Working professionals: Many working professionals use Roth IRAs as a way to supplement their employer-sponsored retirement plans, such as 401(k) or pension plans.</li>
  <li>Self-employed individuals: Self-employed individuals, such as freelancers or small business owners, may use Roth IRAs as a primary means of saving for retirement.</li>
  <li>Retirees: Retirees may use Roth IRAs to manage their retirement income and minimize taxes, ensuring that they have a steady stream of income in their golden years.</li>
