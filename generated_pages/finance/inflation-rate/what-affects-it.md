# What Affects Inflation Rate

Monetary policy, as dictated by central banks, is the single biggest factor affecting inflation rate, as it directly influences the money supply and interest rates, thereby increasing or decreasing inflation by up to 5% annually, as seen in the United States where the Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates in 2018 led to a 2.5% decrease in inflation rate.

## Main Factors
- **Monetary Policy** — the central bank's regulation of money supply and interest rates affects inflation rate by increasing or decreasing it, with a magnitude of up to 5% annually, as seen in the European Central Bank's expansionary monetary policy which led to a 1.5% increase in inflation rate in the Eurozone.
- **Economic Growth** — an increase in economic growth, measured by GDP, typically increases inflation rate by up to 3% annually, as seen in China where a 10% annual GDP growth led to a 4% increase in inflation rate, while a decrease in economic growth decreases inflation rate.
- **Supply and Demand** — an imbalance in supply and demand causes inflation rate to vary, with a shortage of essential goods increasing inflation rate by up to 10% annually, as seen in the 1970s oil embargo which led to a 15% increase in inflation rate in the United States.
- **Fiscal Policy** — government spending and taxation affect inflation rate by increasing or decreasing aggregate demand, with a magnitude of up to 2% annually, as seen in the United States where the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 led to a 1.5% increase in inflation rate.
- **Exchange Rates** — a depreciation of the exchange rate increases inflation rate by up to 5% annually, as seen in the United Kingdom where a 10% depreciation of the pound led to a 3% increase in inflation rate, while an appreciation of the exchange rate decreases inflation rate.
- **Commodity Prices** — an increase in commodity prices, such as oil or food, increases inflation rate by up to 2% annually, as seen in the 2008 food price crisis which led to a 1.5% increase in inflation rate globally.
- **Expectations** — consumer and business expectations of future inflation rates affect current inflation rate, with high expectations increasing inflation rate by up to 1% annually, as seen in the United States where a survey by the University of Michigan found that high inflation expectations led to a 0.5% increase in inflation rate.

## How They Interact
The interaction between **Monetary Policy** and **Economic Growth** amplifies each other, as seen in the United States where the Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates in 2018 led to a decrease in economic growth, which in turn decreased inflation rate. The interaction between **Supply and Demand** and **Commodity Prices** also amplifies each other, as seen in the 1970s oil embargo where a shortage of oil led to an increase in oil prices, which in turn increased inflation rate. The interaction between **Fiscal Policy** and **Exchange Rates** cancels each other, as seen in the United Kingdom where an increase in government spending led to an appreciation of the exchange rate, which in turn decreased inflation rate.

## Controllable vs Uncontrollable
The controllable factors are **Monetary Policy**, **Fiscal Policy**, and **Expectations**, which are controlled by central banks, governments, and consumers respectively. Central banks control monetary policy through regulation of money supply and interest rates, while governments control fiscal policy through regulation of government spending and taxation. Consumers control expectations through their spending and saving decisions. The uncontrollable factors are **Economic Growth**, **Supply and Demand**, **Exchange Rates**, and **Commodity Prices**, which are influenced by a variety of factors including global events, natural disasters, and technological changes. Ricardo's comparative advantage model (1817) provides a framework for understanding the impact of international trade on economic growth and inflation rate.
