# How Inflation Rate Works

Inflation rate is a **macroeconomic** mechanism where an increase in the **money supply** leads to a surge in **aggregate demand**, causing **prices** to rise.

## The Mechanism
The core cause-and-effect chain of inflation rate involves the **monetary policy** set by central banks, which influences the **interest rates** and subsequently affects the **money supply**. As the money supply increases, it fuels **consumer spending** and **investment**, driving up **prices** by around 2-3% annually, as seen in countries with stable economies.

## Step-by-Step
1. The central bank lowers **interest rates** to around 1-2% to stimulate economic growth, increasing the **money supply** by 5-10% through **quantitative easing**.
2. The increased money supply leads to a 10-15% surge in **lending** by commercial banks, as they have more **liquidity** to lend to businesses and individuals, such as Boeing, which produces ~800 aircraft annually (Boeing annual report).
3. As a result, **aggregate demand** increases by 2-5%, driving up **prices** of goods and services, such as housing prices, which rose by 8% in the United States in 2020 (National Association of Realtors).
4. The rise in **prices** reduces the **purchasing power** of consumers by around 5-10%, making them more **price-sensitive** and leading to a decrease in **consumption** by 1-3%.
5. To combat inflation, central banks may raise **interest rates** to 4-6% to reduce the **money supply** and decrease **aggregate demand**, as seen in the **Taylor rule**, which aims to keep inflation around 2% (Taylor, 1993).
6. The reduction in **money supply** leads to a decline in **lending** by commercial banks, resulting in a decrease in **investment** by 5-10% and a subsequent decrease in **prices** by around 1-2%.

## Key Components
- **Monetary policy**: The central bank's control over **interest rates** and **money supply** is crucial in regulating inflation, as seen in Ricardo's comparative advantage model, 1817.
- **Money supply**: An increase in the **money supply** can lead to higher **prices**, while a decrease can lead to lower **prices**.
- **Aggregate demand**: The total demand for goods and services in an economy, influenced by **consumer spending** and **investment**.
- **Prices**: The level of **prices** in an economy, affected by **supply and demand**.

## Common Questions
What happens if the central bank fails to control the **money supply**? If the central bank fails to control the **money supply**, it can lead to **hyperinflation**, as seen in Zimbabwe in 2008, where prices rose by 89.7 sextillion percent (International Monetary Fund).
How does inflation affect **savings**? Inflation reduces the **purchasing power** of **savings** by around 5-10% annually, making it essential to invest in **inflation-indexed** assets, such as Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS).
What is the impact of inflation on **employment**? Inflation can lead to higher **employment** in the short term, as businesses increase production to meet **aggregate demand**, but can lead to higher **unemployment** in the long term if **prices** rise too high, as seen in the **Phillips curve**.
How does inflation affect **international trade**? Inflation can make a country's **exports** less competitive, leading to a trade deficit, as seen in the **exchange rate** mechanism, where a 10% increase in **prices** can lead to a 5-10% decrease in **exports**.
