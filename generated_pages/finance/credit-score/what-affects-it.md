# What Affects Credit Score

1. INTRODUCTION

A credit score is a numerical value that represents an individual's creditworthiness, which is used by lenders to determine the likelihood of repayment. Understanding the factors that affect credit scores is essential for maintaining good credit health and accessing better loan options. Credit scores are calculated based on information in credit reports, and various factors can influence the score. By knowing what affects credit scores, individuals can take steps to improve their credit and make informed financial decisions.

2. MAIN FACTORS

Several key factors contribute to the calculation of credit scores. These include:

- Payment History: This factor refers to the record of payments made on time, late payments, and accounts sent to collections. It influences credit score by demonstrating an individual's ability to manage debt and make payments as agreed. The effect is positive if payments are made on time and negative if payments are late or missed.
- Credit Utilization: This factor represents the amount of credit being used compared to the available credit limit. It influences credit score by showing lenders how well an individual can manage their debt levels. The effect is negative if credit utilization is high and positive if it is low.
- Credit Age: This factor refers to the length of time an individual has had credit. It influences credit score by demonstrating an individual's experience with credit and their ability to manage it over time. The effect is generally positive as credit age increases.
- Credit Mix: This factor represents the variety of credit types an individual has, such as credit cards, loans, and mortgages. It influences credit score by showing lenders that an individual can manage different types of credit. The effect is positive if the credit mix is diverse and negative if it is limited.
- New Credit Inquiries: This factor refers to the number of new credit applications and inquiries made by lenders. It influences credit score by indicating to lenders whether an individual is taking on too much new debt. The effect is variable, as a few inquiries may not significantly impact the score, but multiple inquiries in a short period can be negative.
- Public Records: This factor includes information such as bankruptcies, foreclosures, and tax liens. It influences credit score by demonstrating an individual's history of debt management and financial responsibility. The effect is negative if public records indicate financial difficulties.
- Credit Account Closure: This factor refers to the closure of old or unused credit accounts. It influences credit score by affecting the credit utilization ratio and credit age. The effect is variable, as closing old accounts can be negative if it reduces credit age, but closing unused accounts can be positive if it reduces the risk of fraud.

3. INTERCONNECTIONS

These factors are interconnected, meaning that a change in one factor can affect others. For example, missing a payment can negatively affect payment history, which in turn can increase credit utilization if the overdue amount is added to the total debt. Similarly, applying for new credit can result in new credit inquiries, which may lead to a temporary decrease in credit score. Understanding these interconnections helps individuals make informed decisions about their credit management.

4. CONTROLLABLE VS UNCONTROLLABLE

Some factors that affect credit scores can be controlled by individuals, while others cannot. Controllable factors include payment history, credit utilization, credit mix, and new credit inquiries. By making timely payments, keeping credit utilization low, maintaining a diverse credit mix, and limiting new credit applications, individuals can positively influence their credit scores. Uncontrollable factors, such as public records and credit account closures, may require professional assistance or time to resolve. However, being aware of these factors can help individuals take proactive steps to mitigate their impact.

5. SUMMARY

The most important factors to understand when it comes to credit scores are payment history, credit utilization, and credit age. By managing these factors effectively, individuals can maintain a healthy credit score and improve their financial well-being. Additionally, being aware of the interconnections between factors and understanding which factors can be controlled can help individuals make informed decisions about their credit management. By taking a proactive approach to credit management, individuals can access better loan options, lower interest rates, and improved financial opportunities.
