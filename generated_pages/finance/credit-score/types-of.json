  "content": "There are five main categories of credit scores, organized by their primary purpose and calculation method. \n## Main Categories\n- **FICO Credit Score** \u2014 a credit score calculated based on payment history, credit utilization, and credit age, with a named example being the FICO score used by American Express to evaluate customer creditworthiness for its Gold Card.\n- **VantageScore** \u2014 a credit score developed by the three major credit reporting agencies, Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax, using a combination of credit data and machine learning algorithms, with a named example being the VantageScore used by Bank of America to determine loan eligibility.\n- **Business Credit Score** \u2014 a credit score used to evaluate the creditworthiness of businesses, taking into account factors such as payment history, credit utilization, and industry risk, with a named example being the business credit score used by Wells Fargo to evaluate loan applications from small businesses.\n- **Bankruptcy Risk Score** \u2014 a credit score used to predict the likelihood of an individual or business filing for bankruptcy, using factors such as debt levels, payment history, and credit utilization, with a named example being the bankruptcy risk score used by the Small Business Administration to evaluate loan applications from entrepreneurs.\n- **Alternative Credit Score** \u2014 a credit score that uses non-traditional data, such as rent payments, utility bills, and social media activity, to evaluate an individual's creditworthiness, with a named example being the alternative credit score used by the online lender LendingClub to evaluate loan applications from borrowers with limited credit history.\n\n## Comparison Table\n| Category | Calculation Method | Primary Purpose | Example User |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| FICO Credit Score | Payment history, credit utilization, credit age | Evaluate individual creditworthiness | American Express |\n| VantageScore | Combination of credit data and machine learning algorithms | Evaluate individual creditworthiness | Bank of America |\n| Business Credit Score | Payment history, credit utilization, industry risk | Evaluate business creditworthiness | Wells Fargo |\n| Bankruptcy Risk Score | Debt levels, payment history, credit utilization | Predict bankruptcy risk | Small Business Administration |\n| Alternative Credit Score | Non-traditional data, such as rent payments and social media activity | Evaluate individual creditworthiness for borrowers with limited credit history | LendingClub |\n\n## How They Relate\nThe categories overlap and feed into each other in several ways. For example, a **FICO Credit Score** is often used as a starting point for evaluating an individual's creditworthiness, and a **Business Credit Score** may be used to evaluate the creditworthiness of a business owned by an individual with a strong FICO score. The **VantageScore** and **FICO Credit Score** are often confused, as they are both used to evaluate individual creditworthiness, but they use different calculation methods and have different score ranges. The **Alternative Credit Score** is often used in conjunction with traditional credit scores, such as the **FICO Credit Score**, to get a more complete picture of an individual's creditworthiness. The **Bankruptcy Risk Score** is often used by lenders to evaluate the risk of lending to a business or individual, and may be used in conjunction with other credit scores, such as the **Business Credit Score**, to make lending decisions.",
