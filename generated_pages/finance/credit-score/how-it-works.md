# How Credit Score Works

Credit score calculation involves a complex algorithm that weighs **credit history**, **payment history**, and **credit utilization** to produce a three-digit score, typically ranging from 300 to 850, with higher scores indicating lower credit risk.

## The Mechanism
The core cause-and-effect chain of credit score calculation is driven by the interplay between **credit reporting agencies**, such as Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion, which collect data on individual credit behavior, and **credit scoring models**, such as FICO, which analyze this data to produce a credit score. The process involves the aggregation of credit data, including payment history, credit utilization, and credit age, which is then weighted and scored to produce a final credit score.

## Step-by-Step
1. **Data collection**: Credit reporting agencies gather data on individual credit behavior, including payment history, credit accounts, and credit inquiries, with the average consumer having around 10-15 credit inquiries per year, which can affect their credit score by up to 10 points (FICO).
2. **Credit account analysis**: The credit scoring model analyzes the credit account data, including the type of credit, credit limit, and payment history, with on-time payments accounting for around 35% of the total credit score (FICO), and late payments reducing the score by an average of 60-110 points (Equifax).
3. **Credit utilization calculation**: The credit scoring model calculates the credit utilization ratio, which is the percentage of available credit being used, with a ratio above 30% potentially reducing the credit score by up to 50 points (Experian), and a ratio below 10% potentially increasing the score by up to 20 points (TransUnion).
4. **Credit age analysis**: The credit scoring model analyzes the age of the credit accounts, with older accounts generally having a positive effect on the credit score, and the average credit account age being around 10-15 years (FICO), which can increase the credit score by up to 15 points.
5. **Score calculation**: The credit scoring model weighs the analyzed data and calculates the final credit score, with the FICO model using a weighted average of the different credit factors, including payment history (35%), credit utilization (30%), credit age (15%), and credit mix (10%), to produce a score that accurately reflects the individual's credit risk.
6. **Score reporting**: The final credit score is reported to lenders and other authorized parties, with around 90% of lenders using FICO scores to evaluate creditworthiness (FICO), and the average credit score in the US being around 710 (Experian).

## Key Components
- **Credit reporting agencies**: Collect and maintain credit data, providing it to credit scoring models, and playing a critical role in the credit scoring process, as they provide the raw data used to calculate the credit score.
- **Credit scoring models**: Analyze credit data and calculate the credit score, using complex algorithms and weighted averages to produce a score that accurately reflects the individual's credit risk.
- **Credit accounts**: Provide data on credit behavior, including payment history and credit utilization, and are a critical component of the credit scoring process, as they provide the majority of the data used to calculate the credit score.
- **Payment history**: Accounts for around 35% of the total credit score, and is a critical component of the credit scoring process, as it provides insight into the individual's ability to manage their debt and make on-time payments.

## Common Questions
What happens if a credit account is closed? Closing a credit account can potentially reduce the credit score by up to 10 points, as it can affect the credit utilization ratio and credit age, with the average credit score decreasing by around 5 points after a credit account is closed (FICO).
How often is credit score updated? Credit scores are typically updated every 30-60 days, depending on the credit reporting agency and the frequency of credit account updates, with around 20-30% of credit scores changing each month (Experian).
Can credit score be improved? Yes, credit score can be improved by maintaining a good payment history, keeping credit utilization low, and monitoring credit accounts regularly, with around 60% of consumers seeing an improvement in their credit score after 6-12 months of responsible credit behavior (TransUnion).
What is the minimum credit score required for a loan? The minimum credit score required for a loan varies depending on the lender and the type of loan, but generally, a credit score above 650 is considered good, and a score above 750 is considered excellent, with around 80% of lenders requiring a minimum credit score of 620 for a mortgage loan (Fannie Mae).
