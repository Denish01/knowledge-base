# What Credit Score Depends On

Payment history is the most critical dependency for a credit score, as it directly affects the **credit utilization ratio** and **credit age**, with a notable example being the 2008 financial crisis where borrowers with poor payment histories defaulted on mortgages, leading to a significant decline in credit scores.

## Key Dependencies
- **Payment History** — a record of on-time payments is required to maintain a good credit score, and late payments can significantly lower it, as seen in the case of borrowers who defaulted on mortgages during the 2008 financial crisis, resulting in a decline in credit scores.
- **Credit Utilization Ratio** — the percentage of available credit being used affects credit scores, and high utilization can lead to lower scores, such as in the case of a consumer who maxed out their credit cards and saw a 100-point drop in their credit score.
- **Credit Age** — the length of time an individual has had credit affects their score, with longer credit histories generally resulting in higher scores, as exemplified by a borrower who had a 20-year credit history and a credit score of 800, but saw a 50-point drop after closing old accounts.
- **Credit Mix** — a diverse mix of credit types, such as credit cards, loans, and mortgages, is necessary for a healthy credit score, and a lack of diversity can lead to lower scores, as seen in the case of a consumer who only had credit cards and saw a lower credit score than a consumer with a mix of credit types.
- **New Credit** — new credit inquiries and accounts can affect credit scores, with multiple inquiries in a short period potentially lowering scores, such as in the case of a consumer who applied for multiple credit cards in one month and saw a 20-point drop in their credit score.
- **Public Records** — public records, such as bankruptcies and foreclosures, can significantly lower credit scores, as exemplified by a borrower who declared bankruptcy and saw a 200-point drop in their credit score.

## Priority Order
The priority order of these dependencies, from most to least critical, is:
- Payment history, as it has the greatest impact on credit scores, with late payments able to lower scores by up to 100 points.
- Credit utilization ratio, as high utilization can lead to significant drops in credit scores, such as a 100-point drop for a consumer who maxed out their credit cards.
- Credit age, as a longer credit history generally results in higher scores, with a 20-year credit history resulting in a credit score of 800.
- Credit mix, as a diverse mix of credit types is necessary for a healthy credit score, with a lack of diversity leading to lower scores.
- New credit, as multiple inquiries in a short period can lower scores, such as a 20-point drop for a consumer who applied for multiple credit cards in one month.
- Public records, as while they can significantly lower credit scores, they are relatively rare and often a result of extreme financial difficulties, such as a borrower who declared bankruptcy.

## Common Gaps
People often overlook the importance of **credit age** and **credit mix**, taking for granted that these factors are less important than **payment history** and **credit utilization ratio**. However, neglecting to maintain a long credit history and a diverse mix of credit types can lead to lower credit scores, such as a 50-point drop for a borrower who closed old accounts. Additionally, people may assume that **new credit** inquiries do not significantly affect credit scores, but multiple inquiries in a short period can lead to a significant drop in credit scores, such as a 20-point drop for a consumer who applied for multiple credit cards in one month.
