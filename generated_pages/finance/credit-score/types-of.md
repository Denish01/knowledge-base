# Types of Credit Score

There are five main categories of credit scores, organized by their primary purpose and calculation method. 
## Main Categories
- **FICO Credit Score** — a credit score calculated based on payment history, credit utilization, and credit age, with a named example being the FICO score used by American Express to evaluate customer creditworthiness for its Gold Card.
- **VantageScore** — a credit score developed by the three major credit reporting agencies, Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax, using a combination of credit data and machine learning algorithms, with a named example being the VantageScore used by Bank of America to determine loan eligibility.
- **Business Credit Score** — a credit score used to evaluate the creditworthiness of businesses, taking into account factors such as payment history, credit utilization, and industry risk, with a named example being the business credit score used by Wells Fargo to evaluate loan applications from small businesses.
- **Bankruptcy Risk Score** — a credit score used to predict the likelihood of an individual or business filing for bankruptcy, using factors such as debt levels, payment history, and credit utilization, with a named example being the bankruptcy risk score used by the Small Business Administration to evaluate loan applications from entrepreneurs.
- **Alternative Credit Score** — a credit score that uses non-traditional data, such as rent payments, utility bills, and social media activity, to evaluate an individual's creditworthiness, with a named example being the alternative credit score used by the online lender LendingClub to evaluate loan applications from borrowers with limited credit history.

## Comparison Table
| Category | Calculation Method | Primary Purpose | Example User |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FICO Credit Score | Payment history, credit utilization, credit age | Evaluate individual creditworthiness | American Express |
| VantageScore | Combination of credit data and machine learning algorithms | Evaluate individual creditworthiness | Bank of America |
| Business Credit Score | Payment history, credit utilization, industry risk | Evaluate business creditworthiness | Wells Fargo |
| Bankruptcy Risk Score | Debt levels, payment history, credit utilization | Predict bankruptcy risk | Small Business Administration |
| Alternative Credit Score | Non-traditional data, such as rent payments and social media activity | Evaluate individual creditworthiness for borrowers with limited credit history | LendingClub |

## How They Relate
The categories overlap and feed into each other in several ways. For example, a **FICO Credit Score** is often used as a starting point for evaluating an individual's creditworthiness, and a **Business Credit Score** may be used to evaluate the creditworthiness of a business owned by an individual with a strong FICO score. The **VantageScore** and **FICO Credit Score** are often confused, as they are both used to evaluate individual creditworthiness, but they use different calculation methods and have different score ranges. The **Alternative Credit Score** is often used in conjunction with traditional credit scores, such as the **FICO Credit Score**, to get a more complete picture of an individual's creditworthiness. The **Bankruptcy Risk Score** is often used by lenders to evaluate the risk of lending to a business or individual, and may be used in conjunction with other credit scores, such as the **Business Credit Score**, to make lending decisions.
