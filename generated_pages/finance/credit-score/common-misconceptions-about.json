  "content": "The most common misconception about credit scores is that they are directly tied to income, with many believing that a higher income automatically translates to a higher credit score.\n\n## Misconceptions\n- **Myth:** A higher income guarantees a higher credit score.\n- **Fact:** Credit scores are calculated based on payment history, credit utilization, and credit age, among other factors, with no direct consideration of income, as stated by FICO's credit scoring model.\n- **Source of confusion:** This myth persists due to the common assumption that a higher income naturally leads to better financial management and credit habits, as often implied in personal finance media narratives.\n- **Myth:** Checking credit scores frequently will lower them.\n- **Fact:** Credit score inquiries are categorized as either hard or soft, with only hard inquiries, typically those from lenders, affecting credit scores, as clarified by Experian's credit reporting guidelines, which state that soft inquiries have no impact on credit scores.\n- **Source of confusion:** This myth likely stems from the misunderstanding of the difference between hard and soft inquiries, often not clearly explained in general media coverage.\n- **Myth:** Paying off debts immediately after they are incurred will always improve credit scores.\n- **Fact:** Paying off debts on time is crucial, but the timing of payments can affect credit utilization ratios, with paying off debts too quickly potentially lowering credit scores if it results in a utilization ratio of 0%, as suggested by credit expert Liz Pulliam Weston's advice on maintaining a low but not zero utilization ratio.\n- **Source of confusion:** The myth may arise from oversimplification of credit scoring principles, often found in basic personal finance textbooks that do not delve into nuanced scenarios.\n- **Myth:** Credit scores are directly affected by age.\n- **Fact:** While older credit histories can positively impact credit scores due to the length of credit history being a scoring factor, age itself is not a direct factor, as outlined in the VantageScore credit scoring model.\n- **Source of confusion:** This confusion may stem from the correlation between age and credit history length, which can lead to older individuals having better credit scores on average, as observed in data from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n- **Myth:** Married couples' credit scores are combined or directly affected by each other's credit histories.\n- **Fact:** Credit scores are calculated on an individual basis, with each spouse maintaining their own credit history and score, unaffected by the other's, according to TransUnion's credit reporting policies.\n- **Source of confusion:** The myth likely originates from the concept of joint credit accounts, which can affect both spouses' credit scores if not managed properly, a scenario often discussed in financial planning advice columns.\n- **Myth:** Credit scores can be significantly improved by adding a credit mix, such as loans and credit cards, even if not needed.\n- **Fact:** While a diverse credit mix can positively impact credit scores, taking on unnecessary debt to achieve this diversity is not advisable and can actually harm credit scores if not managed well, as cautioned by NerdWallet's financial advisors against unnecessary credit applications.\n- **Source of confusion:** This misconception may arise from misinterpretation of credit scoring advice that suggests a diverse credit mix is beneficial, without considering the context of responsible credit management.\n\n## Quick Reference\n- **Myth: Higher income guarantees higher credit score** \u2192 **Fact:** Income is not a direct factor in credit score calculation (FICO).\n- **Myth: Frequent credit score checks lower scores** \u2192 **Fact:** Only hard inquiries from lenders affect credit scores (Experian).\n- **Myth: Immediate debt payoff always improves credit scores** \u2192 **Fact:** Timing of payments affects credit utilization ratios, which impact scores (Liz Pulliam Weston).\n- **Myth: Credit scores are directly affected by age** \u2192 **Fact:** Age itself is not a factor, but length of credit history is (VantageScore).\n- **Myth: Married couples' credit scores are combined** \u2192 **Fact:** Each spouse maintains their own credit history and score (TransUnion).\n- **Myth: Adding credit mix always improves scores** \u2192 **Fact:** Unnecessary debt can harm credit scores, despite potential benefits of credit mix diversity (NerdWallet).",
