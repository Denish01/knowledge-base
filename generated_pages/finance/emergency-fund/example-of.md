# Example of Emergency Fund

## Definition
Emergency fund is a pool of readily available funds set aside to cover unexpected expenses, such as medical emergencies, car repairs, or losing a job, originated by **Franklin D. Roosevelt** in the 1930s as part of his economic recovery plan.

## How It Works
An emergency fund works by providing a financial cushion that can help individuals or families navigate unexpected financial setbacks without going into debt. The **50/30/20 rule**, popularized by Senator Elizabeth Warren, suggests allocating 50% of income towards necessary expenses, 30% towards discretionary spending, and 20% towards saving and debt repayment, with a portion of this savings allocated to an emergency fund. Typically, an emergency fund should cover 3-6 months' worth of living expenses, depending on factors such as job security, income stability, and dependents.

The size of an emergency fund can vary greatly depending on individual circumstances. For example, a dual-income household with stable jobs and no dependents may require a smaller emergency fund, while a single-income household with multiple dependents may require a larger one. According to **Ricardo's law of diminishing marginal utility**, the marginal utility of each additional dollar in an emergency fund decreases as the fund grows, so it's essential to strike a balance between saving for emergencies and other financial goals. The **Fisher equation**, which describes the relationship between inflation, interest rates, and exchange rates, also highlights the importance of considering inflation when determining the size of an emergency fund.

In practice, an emergency fund can be invested in low-risk, liquid assets such as **high-yield savings accounts**, **money market funds**, or **short-term bonds**, which provide easy access to funds while earning a small return. The **liquidity premium theory** suggests that investors demand a higher return for holding less liquid assets, so emergency funds are typically invested in highly liquid assets to ensure easy access to funds when needed. Boeing, for example, holds ~$10 billion in cash and cash equivalents (Boeing annual report), which provides a financial cushion in case of unexpected expenses or revenue shortfalls.

## Key Components
- **Savings rate**: The percentage of income allocated to savings, including the emergency fund, which determines how quickly the fund can be replenished in case of a withdrawal.
- **Expense coverage**: The number of months' worth of living expenses that the emergency fund can cover, which determines the level of financial security provided by the fund.
- **Liquidity**: The ease with which funds can be accessed and used to cover unexpected expenses, which is critical in an emergency situation.
- **Return on investment**: The return earned on the emergency fund, which can help keep pace with inflation and maintain the purchasing power of the fund over time.
- **Inflation protection**: The ability of the emergency fund to maintain its purchasing power over time, despite inflation, which is critical to ensuring that the fund remains effective in covering unexpected expenses.
- **Tax efficiency**: The tax implications of the emergency fund, including the tax treatment of interest earned and withdrawals, which can impact the overall return on investment.

## Common Misconceptions
**Myth:** Emergency funds should be invested in **stocks** to earn a higher return — **Fact:** Stocks are not suitable for emergency funds due to their volatility and potential for significant losses, as seen during the 2008 financial crisis (Federal Reserve).
**Myth:** Emergency funds are only necessary for individuals with low incomes — **Fact:** Emergency funds are essential for individuals at all income levels, as unexpected expenses can arise regardless of income, as illustrated by the ~$100,000 average cost of a medical emergency in the United States (American Medical Association).
**Myth:** Emergency funds should be used to pay off **high-interest debt** — **Fact:** Emergency funds should be used to cover unexpected expenses, not to pay off debt, as paying off debt can be done through a separate debt repayment plan, as suggested by **Dave Ramsey**.
**Myth:** Emergency funds are a waste of money because they earn a low return — **Fact:** Emergency funds provide a financial cushion and peace of mind, which is invaluable in times of uncertainty, as highlighted by the **CBO's** estimate that ~40% of Americans cannot cover a $400 emergency expense (Congressional Budget Office).

## In Practice
In 2020, General Motors (GM) faced a significant financial setback due to a **strike** by the United Auto Workers union, which resulted in ~$3.6 billion in losses (GM annual report). However, GM's ~$20 billion cash reserve (GM annual report) provided a financial cushion that helped the company navigate this unexpected expense. This example illustrates the importance of maintaining an emergency fund to cover unexpected expenses and ensure financial stability. By allocating a portion of its income to an emergency fund, GM was able to mitigate the impact of the strike and maintain its financial health.
