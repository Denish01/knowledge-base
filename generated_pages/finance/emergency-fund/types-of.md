# Types of Emergency Fund

There are three main categories of emergency funds, organized by their purpose and scope: **Personal Emergency Funds**, **Business Emergency Funds**, and **Government Emergency Funds**.

## Main Categories
- **Personal Emergency Funds** — designed to cover an individual's living expenses in case of unexpected events, such as job loss or medical emergencies, and are often held in easily accessible savings accounts, like the **Emergency Fund** established by **Fidelity Investments**.
- **Business Emergency Funds** — intended to help companies weather financial storms, such as economic downturns or supply chain disruptions, and may include lines of credit or cash reserves, as seen in **Coca-Cola's** financial planning.
- **Government Emergency Funds** — allocated to respond to large-scale crises, like natural disasters or pandemics, and are typically managed by government agencies, such as the **Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)** in the United States.

## Comparison Table
| Category | Purpose | Funding Source | Access Speed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Personal Emergency Funds | Cover living expenses | Personal savings | Immediate |
| Business Emergency Funds | Weather financial storms | Lines of credit, cash reserves | Short-term |
| Government Emergency Funds | Respond to large-scale crises | Tax revenue, bonds | Medium-term |

## How They Relate
The categories of emergency funds are interconnected, as **Personal Emergency Funds** can be depleted during extended economic downturns, necessitating **Business Emergency Funds** to support employee benefits, and ultimately, **Government Emergency Funds** may be required to stabilize the broader economy, as seen in the response to the 2008 financial crisis, where **General Motors** received government support to prevent bankruptcy. Specific pairs, such as **Personal Emergency Funds** and **Business Emergency Funds**, are often confused due to the overlap in their purposes, but they serve distinct functions, with the former focused on individual financial security and the latter on corporate financial resilience. Additionally, **Business Emergency Funds** and **Government Emergency Funds** can be related, as governments may provide funding or guarantees to support businesses during times of crisis, such as the **Paycheck Protection Program** established by the US government in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
