# What Emergency Fund Depends On

Emergency funds depend on **Income Stability**, as a consistent income stream is necessary to replenish and maintain the fund, and without it, the fund will eventually deplete, as seen in the case of the 2008 financial crisis where many individuals who lost their jobs were unable to recover due to insufficient emergency savings.

## Key Dependencies
- **Income Stability** — required to replenish and maintain the emergency fund, and without it, the fund will eventually deplete, as seen in the case of the 2008 financial crisis where many individuals who lost their jobs were unable to recover due to insufficient emergency savings. 
- **Low Debt** — necessary to minimize expenses and ensure that the emergency fund is not depleted by debt servicing costs, as high-interest debt can quickly erode savings, such as in the case of the American retailer Toys "R" Us, which filed for bankruptcy in 2017 due to an inability to service its debt.
- **Liquid Assets** — needed to provide easy access to funds in case of an emergency, and without them, individuals may be forced to sell illiquid assets at a loss, as seen in the case of the 2000 dot-com bubble where many investors were unable to liquidate their assets quickly enough to avoid significant losses.
- **Expenses Control** — essential to prevent unnecessary expenses from depleting the emergency fund, and without it, individuals may find themselves unable to cope with unexpected expenses, such as in the case of the 2010 BP oil spill where many businesses were unable to recover due to unforeseen expenses.
- **Insurance Coverage** — required to mitigate risks and prevent financial shocks, and without it, individuals may be exposed to significant financial risks, such as in the case of the 2011 Japan earthquake and tsunami where many businesses were unable to recover due to lack of insurance coverage.

## Priority Order
The dependencies can be ranked in order of priority as follows:
- **Income Stability** is the most critical, as it provides the foundation for replenishing and maintaining the emergency fund.
- **Low Debt** is the second most critical, as high debt levels can quickly erode savings and leave individuals vulnerable to financial shocks.
- **Expenses Control** is the third most critical, as it helps to prevent unnecessary expenses from depleting the emergency fund.
- **Liquid Assets** is the fourth most critical, as they provide easy access to funds in case of an emergency.
- **Insurance Coverage** is the fifth most critical, as it helps to mitigate risks and prevent financial shocks, but it is not as essential as the other dependencies.

## Common Gaps
Many people overlook the importance of **Expenses Control** and assume that they can simply cut back on expenses in case of an emergency, but this can be difficult to do in practice, and without a clear plan for expenses control, individuals may find themselves unable to cope with unexpected expenses, as seen in the case of the 2013 US government shutdown where many federal employees were unable to pay their bills due to unforeseen expenses.
