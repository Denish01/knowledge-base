# Example of Asset Allocation

## Definition
Asset allocation is a financial strategy that involves dividing a portfolio's investments among different asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, and commodities, to achieve a desired level of risk and return, a concept rooted in Markowitz's modern portfolio theory, 1952.

## How It Works
Asset allocation works by assigning weights to different asset classes based on an investor's risk tolerance, investment horizon, and financial goals. For example, a conservative investor may allocate 60% of their portfolio to bonds, which offer relatively stable returns with low volatility, such as U.S. Treasury bonds, which have a long-term average return of around 5% (Federal Reserve Economic Data). In contrast, a more aggressive investor may allocate a larger portion of their portfolio to stocks, such as those in the S&P 500 index, which have historically provided higher returns, averaging around 10% per year (S&P Dow Jones Indices).

The allocation process involves considering the correlations between different asset classes, as well as their expected returns and volatilities. The **efficient frontier**, a concept developed by Markowitz, is a graphical representation of the optimal portfolio allocations that offer the highest expected return for a given level of risk. Investors can use this framework to identify the most suitable asset allocation for their needs. According to the **capital asset pricing model** (CAPM), the expected return on an investment is a function of its beta, or systematic risk, relative to the overall market, such as the **Dow Jones Industrial Average**.

The process of asset allocation also involves ongoing monitoring and rebalancing of the portfolio to ensure that it remains aligned with the investor's objectives. This may involve periodically reviewing the portfolio's asset allocation and making adjustments as needed to maintain an optimal mix of investments. For instance, if the stock market experiences a significant decline, an investor may need to rebalance their portfolio by selling bonds and buying stocks to maintain their target asset allocation. Boeing, for example, has a pension fund that allocates its assets among different classes, including stocks, bonds, and real estate, to manage its investment risk and return (Boeing annual report).

## Key Components
- **Risk tolerance**: the investor's ability to withstand potential losses in their portfolio, which influences the allocation of assets to more or less volatile investments, such as **hedge funds** or **money market funds**.
- **Investment horizon**: the length of time an investor has to achieve their financial goals, which affects the allocation of assets to more or less liquid investments, such as **private equity** or **treasury bills**.
- **Diversification**: the spreading of investments across different asset classes to minimize risk, such as investing in **real estate investment trusts** (REITs) or **exchange-traded funds** (ETFs).
- **Correlation**: the relationship between the returns of different asset classes, which can help investors identify opportunities for diversification, such as the negative correlation between **gold prices** and **stock market returns**.
- **Expected return**: the anticipated return on an investment, which is a key factor in determining the optimal asset allocation, such as the expected return on **emerging market stocks** or **high-yield bonds**.
- **Volatility**: the degree of uncertainty or risk associated with an investment, which can impact the allocation of assets to more or less volatile investments, such as **currencies** or **commodities**.

## Common Misconceptions
**Myth:** Asset allocation is only for institutional investors — **Fact:** Individual investors can also benefit from asset allocation, as seen in the case of **Vanguard's target date funds**, which offer diversified portfolios tailored to individual investors' retirement goals.
**Myth:** Asset allocation requires frequent buying and selling of investments — **Fact:** A well-designed asset allocation strategy can be implemented with relatively infrequent rebalancing, such as the **buy-and-hold strategy** employed by **Warren Buffett**.
**Myth:** Asset allocation is a one-time process — **Fact:** Asset allocation is an ongoing process that requires periodic review and rebalancing to ensure that the portfolio remains aligned with the investor's objectives, as recommended by **David Swensen**, chief investment officer at Yale University.
**Myth:** Asset allocation guarantees high returns — **Fact:** Asset allocation is a risk management strategy, not a guarantee of high returns, as evidenced by the **2008 financial crisis**, which highlighted the importance of diversification and risk management.

## In Practice
The **CalPERS** pension fund, one of the largest in the United States, allocates its assets among different classes, including stocks, bonds, and real estate, to manage its investment risk and return. As of 2022, CalPERS had allocated approximately 50% of its portfolio to stocks, 25% to bonds, and 15% to real estate, with the remaining 10% allocated to alternative investments, such as **private equity** and **hedge funds** (CalPERS annual report). This allocation is designed to provide a balance of risk and return, with the goal of meeting the fund's long-term investment objectives. By regularly reviewing and rebalancing its portfolio, CalPERS aims to maintain an optimal asset allocation and ensure the sustainability of its pension fund.
