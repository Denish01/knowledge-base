# What Asset Allocation Depends On

Risk tolerance is the most critical dependency for asset allocation, as it directly affects an investor's ability to withstand market fluctuations and ultimately achieve their financial goals.

## Key Dependencies
- **Risk Tolerance** — is required to determine the optimal asset allocation, as it helps investors balance potential returns with potential losses. Without a clear understanding of risk tolerance, investors may over- or under-allocate to certain asset classes, leading to suboptimal portfolio performance. For instance, the 2008 financial crisis saw many investors who were overly exposed to equities suffer significant losses, highlighting the importance of aligning asset allocation with individual risk tolerance.
- **Time Horizon** — is necessary to determine the appropriate asset allocation, as it affects the investor's ability to ride out market fluctuations. A longer time horizon allows for more aggressive investing, while a shorter time horizon requires a more conservative approach. The dot-com bubble, where many investors with short time horizons suffered significant losses, illustrates the importance of considering time horizon in asset allocation.
- **Investment Goals** — are essential to determine the optimal asset allocation, as they help investors prioritize their objectives, such as growth, income, or capital preservation. Without clear investment goals, investors may struggle to create a cohesive investment strategy, leading to poor portfolio performance. The experience of investors who failed to achieve their retirement goals due to inadequate investment strategies highlights the importance of aligning asset allocation with investment objectives.
- **Income Requirements** — affect asset allocation, as they influence the investor's need for regular income or capital withdrawals. Failing to consider income requirements can lead to insufficient liquidity, forcing investors to sell assets at unfavorable prices. The 2020 market downturn saw many investors who were overly reliant on portfolio income struggle to meet their cash flow needs, underscoring the importance of considering income requirements in asset allocation.
- **Tax Efficiency** — is crucial for asset allocation, as it helps minimize tax liabilities and maximize after-tax returns. Ignoring tax implications can result in significant tax liabilities, reducing the investor's net returns. The experience of investors who held tax-inefficient investments, such as high-yield bonds in taxable accounts, demonstrates the importance of considering tax efficiency in asset allocation.
- **Liquidity Needs** — are necessary to determine the optimal asset allocation, as they affect the investor's ability to meet unexpected expenses or cash flow requirements. Failing to consider liquidity needs can lead to forced asset sales, resulting in suboptimal portfolio performance. The 2008 financial crisis saw many investors who were illiquid struggle to meet their cash flow needs, highlighting the importance of considering liquidity needs in asset allocation.

## Priority Order
The dependencies can be ranked from most to least critical as follows:
- Risk tolerance is the most critical, as it directly affects the investor's ability to withstand market fluctuations and ultimately achieve their financial goals.
- Time horizon is the second most critical, as it influences the investor's ability to ride out market fluctuations and pursue long-term investment objectives.
- Investment goals are the third most critical, as they help investors prioritize their objectives and create a cohesive investment strategy.
- Income requirements are the fourth most critical, as they affect the investor's need for regular income or capital withdrawals.
- Tax efficiency is the fifth most critical, as it helps minimize tax liabilities and maximize after-tax returns.
- Liquidity needs are the sixth most critical, as they affect the investor's ability to meet unexpected expenses or cash flow requirements.

## Common Gaps
Many investors overlook or take for granted the importance of **inflation expectations** in asset allocation, assuming that inflation will remain low and stable. However, failing to consider inflation expectations can lead to inadequate portfolio diversification and suboptimal returns, as seen in the 1970s when high inflation caught many investors off guard. Additionally, some investors assume that **past performance** is a reliable indicator of future results, leading to over-allocation to certain asset classes and potential losses when market conditions change.
