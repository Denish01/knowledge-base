# How Asset Allocation Works

Asset allocation works by distributing investments across different **asset classes**, such as stocks, bonds, and commodities, to balance risk and potential returns. This process involves analyzing an investor's risk tolerance, financial goals, and time horizon to create a diversified portfolio that can produce an optimal return of around 7-8% annually (BlackRock).

## The Mechanism
The core cause-and-effect chain of asset allocation involves assigning weights to different asset classes based on their expected returns and volatility, which in turn affects the overall portfolio performance. For instance, a portfolio with a 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds can produce a return of around 6-7% annually, with a volatility of 10-12% (Vanguard).

## Step-by-Step
1. **Risk assessment**: The investor's risk tolerance is evaluated, which determines the optimal allocation of assets, resulting in a risk score of 1-10, with 10 being the highest risk (Charles Schwab). This score is used to determine the allocation of assets, such as a 70% allocation to stocks for a high-risk investor.
2. **Asset class selection**: The investor selects the asset classes to include in the portfolio, such as domestic stocks, international stocks, and bonds, which can produce returns of 8-10%, 6-8%, and 4-6% respectively (Fidelity). The selection of asset classes is based on factors such as expected returns, volatility, and correlation with other assets.
3. **Weight assignment**: The investor assigns weights to each asset class, such as a 40% allocation to domestic stocks, 30% to international stocks, and 30% to bonds, which can result in a portfolio with a return of around 7-8% annually (T. Rowe Price). The weights are assigned based on the investor's risk tolerance and financial goals.
4. **Portfolio construction**: The investor constructs the portfolio by purchasing the selected assets in the assigned weights, resulting in a portfolio with a volatility of 10-12% (Vanguard). The portfolio is constructed using a **strategic asset allocation** approach, which involves allocating assets based on long-term expectations.
5. **Portfolio rebalancing**: The investor periodically rebalances the portfolio to maintain the target weights, which can result in a reduction of portfolio volatility by 1-2% (BlackRock). Rebalancing involves buying or selling assets to maintain the target weights, which can help to reduce risk and increase returns.
6. **Performance monitoring**: The investor monitors the portfolio's performance, which can result in a return of around 7-8% annually, with a volatility of 10-12% (Vanguard). The performance is monitored using metrics such as return, volatility, and Sharpe ratio.

## Key Components
- **Asset classes**: The different types of assets, such as stocks, bonds, and commodities, which have distinct expected returns and volatility profiles. If an asset class is removed, the portfolio's risk-return profile changes, such as removing stocks can reduce the portfolio's return by 2-3% annually (Fidelity).
- **Risk tolerance**: The investor's ability to withstand losses, which determines the optimal allocation of assets. If an investor's risk tolerance changes, the portfolio's asset allocation must be adjusted, such as increasing the allocation to bonds by 10% (Charles Schwab).
- **Time horizon**: The investor's investment timeframe, which affects the optimal allocation of assets. If the time horizon changes, the portfolio's asset allocation must be adjusted, such as increasing the allocation to stocks by 10% for a longer time horizon (T. Rowe Price).
- **Diversification**: The process of spreading investments across different asset classes to reduce risk. If diversification is not implemented, the portfolio's risk increases, such as a portfolio with only stocks can have a volatility of 15-20% (Vanguard).

## Common Questions
What happens if the investor's risk tolerance changes? The portfolio's asset allocation must be adjusted to reflect the new risk tolerance, such as increasing the allocation to bonds by 10% (Charles Schwab). 
What is the impact of inflation on asset allocation? Inflation can reduce the purchasing power of the portfolio's returns, so the investor may need to adjust the portfolio's asset allocation to maintain the target return, such as increasing the allocation to inflation-indexed bonds by 5% (BlackRock).
How often should the portfolio be rebalanced? The portfolio should be rebalanced periodically, such as every 6-12 months, to maintain the target weights and reduce portfolio volatility by 1-2% (Vanguard).
What is the role of **tactical asset allocation** in portfolio management? Tactical asset allocation involves making short-term adjustments to the portfolio's asset allocation in response to changes in market conditions, which can result in a return of around 8-10% annually, with a volatility of 12-15% (Fidelity).
