# Types of Asset Allocation

There are three primary categories of asset allocation, distinguished by their strategic approach to investing: strategic, tactical, and core-satellite. 
## Main Categories
- **Strategic Asset Allocation** — a long-term approach to investing that involves allocating assets based on an investor's risk tolerance and investment objectives, as seen in the **Vanguard 500 Index Fund**, which tracks the S&P 500 index and provides broad diversification.
- **Tactical Asset Allocation** — a short-term approach to investing that involves actively adjusting asset allocations in response to changing market conditions, as exemplified by **Goldman Sachs Asset Management**, which uses a combination of quantitative models and fundamental research to make tactical investment decisions.
- **Core-Satellite Asset Allocation** — a hybrid approach to investing that combines a core portfolio of long-term holdings with a satellite portfolio of shorter-term, tactical investments, as illustrated by the **BlackRock Core-Satellite Portfolio**, which allocates 60% to a core portfolio of index funds and 40% to a satellite portfolio of actively managed funds.

## Comparison Table
| Category | Investment Horizon | Risk Level | Management Style |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Strategic Asset Allocation | Long-term (5+ years) | Medium | Passive |
| Tactical Asset Allocation | Short-term (less than 1 year) | High | Active |
| Core-Satellite Asset Allocation | Medium-term (1-5 years) | Medium-High | Hybrid |

## How They Relate
The categories of asset allocation often overlap or are commonly confused, particularly between **Strategic Asset Allocation** and **Core-Satellite Asset Allocation**, as both involve a long-term approach to investing. However, **Strategic Asset Allocation** is a more rigid approach, whereas **Core-Satellite Asset Allocation** allows for more flexibility in responding to changing market conditions. **Tactical Asset Allocation**, on the other hand, is often used in conjunction with **Strategic Asset Allocation**, as investors may use tactical allocation to adjust their portfolios in response to short-term market fluctuations while maintaining a long-term strategic approach. For example, an investor using **Strategic Asset Allocation** may also employ **Tactical Asset Allocation** to temporarily shift assets from stocks to bonds during a market downturn. Additionally, **Core-Satellite Asset Allocation** can be used to combine the benefits of **Strategic Asset Allocation** and **Tactical Asset Allocation**, by allocating a core portfolio to a long-term strategic approach and a satellite portfolio to a shorter-term tactical approach.
