# Types of Mutual Fund

There are five primary categories of mutual funds, organized by their investment objectives and strategies. 
## Main Categories
- **Equity Fund** — invests primarily in stocks, seeking long-term growth and typically carrying higher risk, as seen in the **Fidelity 500 Index Fund**, which tracks the S&P 500.
- **Fixed Income Fund** — invests in bonds and other debt securities, aiming for regular income and relatively lower risk, exemplified by the **Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund**, which holds a broad portfolio of US bonds.
- **Money Market Fund** — focuses on low-risk, short-term debt instruments, providing liquidity and preserving capital, such as the **JPMorgan Prime Money Market Fund**, which invests in commercial paper and treasury bills.
- **Hybrid Fund** — combines different asset classes, like stocks and bonds, to balance risk and return, as illustrated by the **Vanguard Balanced Index Fund**, which allocates 60% to stocks and 40% to bonds.
- **Sector Fund** — concentrates on a specific industry or sector, such as technology or healthcare, seeking to capitalize on growth opportunities, like the **T. Rowe Price Science and Technology Fund**, which invests in companies involved in science and technology.

## Comparison Table
| Category | Risk Level | Typical Investment Horizon | Average Annual Return |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Equity Fund | High | Long-term (5+ years) | 8-12% (S&P 500 historical average) |
| Fixed Income Fund | Medium | Medium-term (3-5 years) | 4-7% (US bond market historical average) |
| Money Market Fund | Low | Short-term (less than 1 year) | 2-4% (commercial paper and treasury bill yields) |
| Hybrid Fund | Medium | Medium-term (3-5 years) | 6-10% (balanced portfolio historical average) |
| Sector Fund | High | Long-term (5+ years) | 10-15% (sector-specific historical averages) |

## How They Relate
The categories can overlap, as **Equity Funds** may hold a portion of their portfolio in **Fixed Income** securities to manage risk, while **Hybrid Funds** blend elements of both **Equity** and **Fixed Income** strategies. **Sector Funds** are a type of **Equity Fund** but focus on specific industries, and **Money Market Funds** often serve as a low-risk component in **Hybrid Funds** or as a cash management tool for investors. Specific pairs, such as **Equity Funds** and **Sector Funds**, are commonly confused due to their shared focus on stock investments, but **Sector Funds** are distinguished by their concentrated sector exposure.
