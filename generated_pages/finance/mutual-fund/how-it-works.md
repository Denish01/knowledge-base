# How Mutual Fund Works

Mutual funds work by pooling money from multiple investors to invest in a diversified portfolio of **stocks**, **bonds**, and other **securities**, allowing individuals to benefit from professional management and economies of scale. The core mechanism involves collecting funds from investors, investing them in a portfolio, and then distributing the returns back to the investors in proportion to their investment.

## The Mechanism
The mutual fund mechanism is driven by the **net asset value (NAV)** of the fund, which is calculated by dividing the total value of the portfolio by the number of outstanding shares. As the portfolio generates returns, the NAV increases, and investors can redeem their shares at the new NAV, effectively receiving their proportionate share of the returns.

## Step-by-Step
1. Investors purchase shares of a mutual fund by submitting their money to the fund manager, who then combines it with money from other investors, creating a large pool of capital, such as the ~$1.4 trillion managed by **Vanguard**.
2. The fund manager invests the pooled money in a diversified portfolio of **stocks**, **bonds**, and other **securities**, aiming to achieve the fund's investment objectives, such as the 8% annual return targeted by the **Fidelity 500 Index Fund**.
3. As the portfolio generates returns, the fund manager calculates the new **NAV** by dividing the total value of the portfolio by the number of outstanding shares, ensuring that each investor's share of the returns is proportional to their investment, with some funds like **T. Rowe Price** distributing dividends quarterly.
4. Investors can redeem their shares at the new **NAV**, effectively receiving their proportionate share of the returns, with some funds like **Charles Schwab** offering online redemption platforms for added convenience.
5. The fund manager continuously monitors the portfolio and makes adjustments as needed to maintain the desired asset allocation and risk profile, such as the 60/40 **stock/bond** split recommended by **Harry Markowitz's modern portfolio theory**.
6. The mutual fund company distributes periodic statements to investors, detailing their account balance, investment returns, and any fees or expenses associated with the fund, such as the 0.05% annual management fee charged by **BlackRock**.

## Key Components
- **Fund manager**: responsible for investing the pooled money and making decisions about the portfolio, such as **Warren Buffett's** value investing approach.
- **Investment portfolio**: the collection of **stocks**, **bonds**, and other **securities** in which the mutual fund invests, like the **S&P 500** index.
- **Net asset value (NAV)**: the price at which investors buy and sell shares of the mutual fund, calculated daily by funds like **Fidelity**.
- **Shareholders**: the individuals or institutions that invest in the mutual fund, such as **CalPERS**, the California Public Employees' Retirement System.

## Common Questions
What happens if the mutual fund company goes bankrupt? In such an event, the **Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC)** typically steps in to protect investors' assets, up to $500,000, including a $250,000 limit for cash claims.
How do mutual funds make money? Mutual funds generate revenue through management fees, typically ranging from 0.05% to 2.00% of the fund's assets, as well as other expenses like administrative and marketing costs.
Can I withdraw my money from a mutual fund at any time? Most mutual funds allow investors to redeem their shares at any time, but some may impose penalties or fees for early withdrawal, such as the 1% fee charged by **T. Rowe Price** for withdrawals within 30 days of purchase.
What is the minimum investment required for a mutual fund? The minimum investment requirement varies by fund, but some funds like **Vanguard** offer low or no minimums for certain accounts, such as IRAs or 401(k)s.
