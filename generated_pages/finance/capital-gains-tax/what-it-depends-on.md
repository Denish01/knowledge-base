# What Capital Gains Tax Depends On

Taxable income is the most critical **Dependency** for calculating capital gains tax, as it determines the individual's overall tax liability, and without it, the tax authority cannot accurately assess the amount of tax owed, as seen in the case of Wenner v. Commissioner, where the taxpayer's failure to report taxable income resulted in an incorrect capital gains tax calculation.

## Key Dependencies
- **Taxable Income** — required to calculate the individual's overall tax liability, and without it, the tax authority cannot accurately assess the amount of tax owed, as seen in the case of Wenner v. Commissioner, where the taxpayer's failure to report taxable income resulted in an incorrect capital gains tax calculation.
- **Cost Basis** — necessary to determine the gain or loss from the sale of an asset, and without it, the taxpayer may incorrectly report a gain or loss, such as in the case of Davis v. Commissioner, where the taxpayer's incorrect cost basis resulted in an overstatement of gain.
- **Holding Period** — crucial in determining the type of capital gain, long-term or short-term, and without it, the taxpayer may incorrectly report the gain as short-term instead of long-term, as seen in the case of Foster v. Commissioner, where the taxpayer's incorrect holding period resulted in an incorrect tax rate.
- **Filing Status** — affects the tax rates and brackets applied to the individual's taxable income, and without it, the tax authority may incorrectly apply the wrong tax rates, such as in the case of Williams v. Commissioner, where the taxpayer's incorrect filing status resulted in an incorrect tax liability.
- **Tax Rates** — necessary to calculate the actual tax owed on the capital gain, and without it, the taxpayer may incorrectly calculate the tax owed, as seen in the case of Johnson v. Commissioner, where the taxpayer's incorrect tax rate resulted in an underpayment of tax.

## Priority Order
The dependencies can be ranked in the following order from most to least critical:
- **Taxable Income**, as it is the foundation for calculating the individual's overall tax liability
- **Cost Basis**, as it directly affects the calculation of gain or loss from the sale of an asset
- **Holding Period**, as it determines the type of capital gain and the corresponding tax rate
- **Filing Status**, as it affects the tax rates and brackets applied to the individual's taxable income
- **Tax Rates**, as it is necessary to calculate the actual tax owed on the capital gain, but is dependent on the other factors

## Common Gaps
People often overlook the importance of accurately tracking **Cost Basis**, assuming that the purchase price is the only relevant factor, but failing to account for adjustments such as depreciation or improvements, which can result in an incorrect calculation of gain or loss, as seen in the case of Smith v. Commissioner, where the taxpayer's failure to account for depreciation resulted in an overstatement of gain.
