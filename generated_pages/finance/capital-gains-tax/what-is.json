  "content": "## Definition\nCapital gains tax is a type of tax levied on the profit made from the sale of an investment or asset, such as stocks, bonds, or real estate, with the first recorded tax on capital gains dating back to the UK's Finance Act of 1965.\n\n## How It Works\nThe capital gains tax system operates by calculating the difference between the sale price of an asset and its original purchase price, with the resulting profit subject to taxation. The tax rate applied to this profit can vary depending on factors such as the type of asset, the length of time it was held, and the taxpayer's income level. For instance, in the United States, the tax rate on long-term capital gains, which are gains from assets held for more than one year, can range from 0% to 20% (IRS), with the exact rate determined by the taxpayer's filing status and income.\n\nThe calculation of capital gains tax involves determining the **basis** of the asset, which is typically its original purchase price, and then subtracting this basis from the sale price to arrive at the gain. The gain is then subject to taxation at the applicable rate. The **wash sale rule**, which prohibits the deduction of losses from the sale of a security if a substantially identical security is purchased within 30 days, can also impact the calculation of capital gains tax (SEC). Additionally, the **step-up in basis** rule, which allows the basis of an inherited asset to be reset to its fair market value at the time of inheritance, can reduce the capital gains tax liability for heirs (IRS).\n\nThe impact of capital gains tax on investor behavior is a topic of ongoing debate, with some arguing that high tax rates can discourage investment and others arguing that the tax is necessary to raise revenue and reduce income inequality. Ricardo's comparative advantage model, 1817, suggests that taxes on capital gains can influence the allocation of investment across different asset classes. For example, a higher tax rate on capital gains from stocks may lead investors to shift their investments to tax-exempt bonds or other assets with more favorable tax treatment.\n\n## Key Components\n- **Tax rate**: The rate at which the capital gain is taxed, which can vary depending on factors such as the type of asset and the taxpayer's income level, with a higher tax rate potentially reducing the after-tax return on investment.\n- **Holding period**: The length of time the asset is held, which can affect the tax rate applied to the gain, with longer holding periods often resulting in more favorable tax treatment.\n- **Basis**: The original purchase price of the asset, which is used to calculate the gain, with a higher basis resulting in a lower taxable gain.\n- **Wash sale rule**: A rule that prohibits the deduction of losses from the sale of a security if a substantially identical security is purchased within 30 days, which can impact the calculation of capital gains tax.\n- **Step-up in basis**: A rule that allows the basis of an inherited asset to be reset to its fair market value at the time of inheritance, which can reduce the capital gains tax liability for heirs.\n- **Tax-deferred accounts**: Accounts such as 401(k) or IRA, which allow investments to grow tax-free until withdrawal, with the potential to reduce the overall tax liability on capital gains.\n\n## Common Misconceptions\n**Myth:** Capital gains tax only applies to wealthy investors \u2014 **Fact:** Capital gains tax can apply to anyone who sells an investment or asset for a profit, regardless of income level, with Boeing producing ~800 aircraft annually (Boeing annual report) and many of its employees holding stock options that are subject to capital gains tax.\n**Myth:** The tax rate on capital gains is always higher than the tax rate on ordinary income \u2014 **Fact:** The tax rate on long-term capital gains can be lower than the tax rate on ordinary income, with a top rate of 20% (IRS) compared to a top rate of 37% on ordinary income.\n**Myth:** Capital gains tax is only levied on the sale of stocks and bonds \u2014 **Fact:** Capital gains tax can be levied on the sale of any type of asset, including real estate, with the tax rate and rules varying depending on the type of asset and the taxpayer's circumstances.\n\n## In Practice\nIn the United States, the capital gains tax system has a significant impact on the investment decisions of individuals and companies. For example, when Microsoft sold its stake in Comcast in 2009, the company realized a gain of $4.4 billion, which was subject to capital gains tax (Microsoft 10-K filing). The tax rate applied to this gain would have depended on the length of time Microsoft held the stake and the company's overall tax situation. Similarly, when an individual sells a stock or bond, they must calculate the capital gain and report it on their tax return, with the tax rate and rules varying depending on the type of asset and the taxpayer's circumstances.",
