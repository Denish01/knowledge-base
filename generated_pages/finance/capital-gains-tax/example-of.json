For example, if an individual purchases a stock for $1,000 and sells it for $1,500, the capital gain would be $500. The tax rate on this gain would depend on the **long-term capital gains rate**, which applies to assets held for more than one year, or the **short-term capital gains rate**, which applies to assets held for one year or less. According to Ricardo's comparative advantage model, 1817, the tax rate on capital gains can influence investment decisions, with lower tax rates potentially leading to increased investment in certain assets.\n\nThe **wash sale rule** is another important mechanism in the capital gains tax system, which prevents taxpayers from claiming a loss on the sale of an asset if they purchase a **substantially identical** asset within 30 days of the sale. This rule is designed to prevent taxpayers from abusing the tax system by selling assets at a loss and then immediately repurchasing them. Boeing produces ~800 aircraft annually (Boeing annual report), and the company's investors must consider the capital gains tax implications of buying and selling Boeing stock. The **tax basis** of the stock, which is the original purchase price, is used to calculate the capital gain or loss when the stock is sold.\n\nThe **step-up in basis** rule is also relevant to capital gains tax, as it allows the **cost basis** of an asset to be increased to its **fair market value** at the time of the owner's death. This can help reduce the capital gains tax liability for the owner's heirs, as they will only be taxed on the gain from the date of the owner's death, rather than the original purchase date. For example, if an individual inherits a stock that was originally purchased for $1,000 but has a fair market value of $5,000 at the time of the owner's death, the heir's cost basis would be $5,000, rather than $1,000.\n\n## Key Components\n- **Holding period**: The length of time an asset is held determines whether it is subject to long-term or short-term capital gains tax rates, with long-term rates generally being lower.\n- **Filing status**: The taxpayer's filing status, such as single or married, can affect the tax rate on capital gains, with married couples often facing lower tax rates.\n- **Cost basis**: The original purchase price of an asset, which is used to calculate the capital gain or loss when the asset is sold.\n- **Sale price**: The price at which an asset is sold, which is used to calculate the capital gain or loss.\n- **Tax basis**: The original purchase price of an asset, which is used to calculate the capital gain or loss when the asset is sold.\n- **Wash sale rule**: A rule that prevents taxpayers from claiming a loss on the sale of an asset if they purchase a substantially identical asset within 30 days of the sale.\n\n## Common Misconceptions\n**Myth:** Capital gains tax only applies to stocks and bonds \u2014 **Fact:** Capital gains tax applies to all types of investments and assets, including real estate, art, and collectibles.\n**Myth:** The capital gains tax rate is the same for all taxpayers \u2014 **Fact:** The tax rate on capital gains varies based on the taxpayer's filing status and income level, with higher-income taxpayers facing higher tax rates.\n**Myth:** The wash sale rule only applies to stocks \u2014 **Fact:** The wash sale rule applies to all types of assets, including bonds, mutual funds, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n**Myth:** The step-up in basis rule applies to all assets \u2014 **Fact:** The step-up in basis rule only applies to assets that are transferred at the time of the owner's death, and does not apply to assets that are sold or gifted during the owner's lifetime.\n\n## In Practice\nIn the United States, the capital gains tax rate can range from 0% to 20%, depending on the taxpayer's filing status and income level. For example, if an individual purchases a stock for $10,000 and sells it for $15,000, the capital gain would be $5,000. If the individual is single and has an income of $50,000, the tax rate on the capital gain would be 15%, resulting in a tax liability of $750. However, if the individual is married and has an income of $100,000, the tax rate on the capital gain would be 20%, resulting in a tax liability of $1,000.
