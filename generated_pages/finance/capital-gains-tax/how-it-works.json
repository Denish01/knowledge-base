  "content": "Capital gains tax is a **taxation mechanism** that imposes a tax on the profit realized from the sale of a non-inventory asset, such as stocks, bonds, or real estate, with the tax rate depending on the **holding period** and **tax bracket** of the seller. The core cause-and-effect chain involves the sale of an asset, triggering a tax calculation based on the **capital gain**, which is the difference between the sale price and the **cost basis**, resulting in a tax liability.\n\n## The Mechanism\nThe mechanism of capital gains tax involves the sale of an asset, triggering a tax calculation based on the **capital gain**, which is the difference between the sale price and the **cost basis**. This tax calculation is typically performed by applying a **tax rate**, such as 15% or 20%, to the **taxable gain**, resulting in a tax liability.\n\n## Step-by-Step\n1. An asset, such as a stock or a piece of real estate, is sold for a **sale price**, which is $100,000 in the case of a stock sold on the New York Stock Exchange.\n2. The **cost basis** of the asset, which is the original purchase price of $80,000, is subtracted from the sale price to determine the **capital gain**, resulting in a gain of $20,000.\n3. The **holding period** of the asset is determined, with assets held for more than one year qualifying for **long-term capital gains** treatment, which has a lower tax rate, such as 15%, compared to **short-term capital gains**, which are taxed at a higher rate, such as 35%.\n4. The **taxable gain** is calculated by applying any applicable **tax deductions** or **exclusions**, such as the **primary residence exemption**, which allows for a **tax-free gain** of up to $500,000 for married couples, resulting in a taxable gain of $15,000.\n5. The tax liability is calculated by applying the applicable **tax rate**, such as 15%, to the **taxable gain**, resulting in a tax liability of $2,250.\n6. The tax liability is paid to the government, such as the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), by the seller, with the payment due by the **tax filing deadline**, which is typically April 15th.\n\n## Key Components\n- **Cost basis**: the original purchase price of the asset, which is used to determine the **capital gain**.\n- **Holding period**: the length of time the asset is held, which determines whether it is eligible for **long-term capital gains** treatment.\n- **Tax rate**: the percentage rate applied to the **taxable gain** to determine the tax liability, such as 15% or 20%.\n- **Taxable gain**: the amount of gain that is subject to tax, after applying any applicable **tax deductions** or **exclusions**.\n\n## Common Questions\nWhat happens if the seller has a **loss** on the sale of an asset? The **loss** can be used to offset **gains** from other assets, reducing the overall tax liability, such as a $10,000 loss on the sale of a stock offsetting a $10,000 gain on the sale of another stock. \nWhat is the **wash sale rule**, and how does it affect the **tax treatment** of a sale? The **wash sale rule** prohibits the deduction of **losses** from the sale of a **security** if a **substantially identical security** is purchased within 30 days, such as buying back a stock that was sold at a loss. \nHow does the **primary residence exemption** affect the **tax treatment** of the sale of a home? The **primary residence exemption** allows for a **tax-free gain** of up to $500,000 for married couples, such as a couple selling their primary residence for a $600,000 gain and paying no tax on the first $500,000. \nWhat is the **tax implications** of **gifting** an asset, such as a stock or a piece of real estate? **Gifting** an asset can result in the recipient inheriting the **cost basis** of the asset, potentially increasing their tax liability when they sell the asset, such as gifting a stock with a **cost basis** of $50,000 and a **fair market value** of $100,000.",
