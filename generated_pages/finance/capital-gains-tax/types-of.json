  "content": "There are four main categories of **Capital Gains Tax**, which are organized based on the type of asset being sold and the duration of ownership. \n\n## Main Categories\n- **Short-Term Capital Gains Tax** \u2014 applies to assets held for less than one year, such as stocks or bonds, and is taxed as ordinary income, with **Apple** being a well-known example of a company whose stocks are frequently subject to short-term capital gains tax.\n- **Long-Term Capital Gains Tax** \u2014 applies to assets held for more than one year, such as real estate or investments, and is taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income, with **Warren Buffett's** long-term investment in **Coca-Cola** being a notable example.\n- **Section 1244 Capital Gains Tax** \u2014 applies to losses from the sale of small business stock, allowing for ordinary loss treatment, with **Google's** early investors being an example of those who could have utilized this tax provision.\n- **Superfund Capital Gains Tax** \u2014 a type of tax on gains from the sale of certain types of assets, such as collectibles or precious metals, with **Sotheby's** auction house being a platform where such assets are frequently sold.\n\n## Comparison Table\n| Category | Tax Rate | Asset Type | Holding Period |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Short-Term | ordinary income rate | stocks, bonds | < 1 year |\n| Long-Term | 0-20% | real estate, investments | > 1 year |\n| Section 1244 | ordinary loss rate | small business stock | N/A |\n| Superfund | 28% | collectibles, precious metals | N/A |\n\n## How They Relate\nThe categories of **Capital Gains Tax** can overlap, such as when a **long-term capital gain** is also subject to **Superfund** tax rates if the gain is from the sale of a collectible. **Short-term capital gains** and **long-term capital gains** are often confused, but the primary distinction lies in the holding period, with **short-term** applying to assets held for less than one year and **long-term** applying to assets held for more than one year. Additionally, **Section 1244** and **Superfund** taxes are often misunderstood as being mutually exclusive, but they can actually apply to the same asset if it meets the specific criteria for each category, such as a small business stock that is also a collectible. The **Ricardo's comparative advantage model** (1817) can be used to understand the economic implications of these tax categories on investment decisions. **Boeing's** tax strategy, for instance, involves careful consideration of these tax categories to minimize tax liability, with the company producing ~800 aircraft annually (Boeing annual report).",
