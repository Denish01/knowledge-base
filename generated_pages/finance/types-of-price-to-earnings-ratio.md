# Types of Price To Earnings Ratio

1. INTRODUCTION:
The price to earnings ratio (P/E ratio) is a widely used metric in finance that helps investors and analysts evaluate the value of a company's stock. It is calculated by dividing the current stock price by the company's earnings per share. Understanding the different types of price to earnings ratio is essential for making informed investment decisions, as each type provides unique insights into a company's financial performance and growth potential. Classification of these types matters because it enables investors to choose the most suitable metric for their analysis, depending on the company's specific characteristics and the investor's goals. By recognizing the various types of P/E ratios, investors can better assess a company's valuation, identify potential risks and opportunities, and make more accurate comparisons between different companies.

2. MAIN CATEGORIES:
- **Trailing P/E Ratio**
  - Definition: The trailing P/E ratio is calculated using the company's earnings per share from the previous 12 months. It reflects the company's past performance and is widely used as a benchmark for valuation.
  - Key characteristics: Uses historical earnings data, provides a snapshot of the company's past performance.
  - Example: If a company's current stock price is $50 and its earnings per share over the past 12 months were $2, the trailing P/E ratio would be 25 ($50 / $2).
- **Forward P/E Ratio**
  - Definition: The forward P/E ratio is calculated using the company's projected earnings per share for the next 12 months. It provides insight into the company's expected future performance.
  - Key characteristics: Uses forecasted earnings data, reflects the company's future growth prospects.
  - Example: If a company's current stock price is $50 and its projected earnings per share for the next 12 months are $3, the forward P/E ratio would be 16.67 ($50 / $3).
- **Shiller P/E Ratio**
  - Definition: The Shiller P/E ratio, also known as the cyclically adjusted P/E ratio, is calculated using the company's average earnings per share over the past 10 years, adjusted for inflation. It helps smooth out fluctuations in earnings and provides a long-term perspective on valuation.
  - Key characteristics: Uses historical earnings data over a 10-year period, adjusts for inflation.
  - Example: If a company's current stock price is $50 and its average earnings per share over the past 10 years, adjusted for inflation, were $4, the Shiller P/E ratio would be 12.5 ($50 / $4).
- **Price to Earnings Growth Ratio (PEG Ratio)**
  - Definition: The PEG ratio is a variation of the P/E ratio that takes into account the company's expected growth rate. It is calculated by dividing the P/E ratio by the company's expected earnings growth rate.
  - Key characteristics: Uses the P/E ratio and expected earnings growth rate, provides insight into the company's valuation relative to its growth prospects.
  - Example: If a company's P/E ratio is 20 and its expected earnings growth rate is 10%, the PEG ratio would be 2 (20 / 10%).

3. COMPARISON TABLE:
| Type of P/E Ratio | Calculation | Key Characteristics | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Trailing P/E | Current stock price / past 12 months' earnings per share | Uses historical earnings data | 25 ($50 / $2) |
| Forward P/E | Current stock price / projected earnings per share for the next 12 months | Uses forecasted earnings data | 16.67 ($50 / $3) |
| Shiller P/E | Current stock price / average earnings per share over the past 10 years, adjusted for inflation | Smoothes out fluctuations in earnings | 12.5 ($50 / $4) |
| PEG Ratio | P/E ratio / expected earnings growth rate | Takes into account expected growth rate | 2 (20 / 10%) |

4. HOW THEY RELATE:
The different types of price to earnings ratio are connected in that they all provide a measure of a company's valuation, but they differ in the data they use and the perspective they offer. The trailing P/E ratio looks at past performance, while the forward P/E ratio looks at expected future performance. The Shiller P/E ratio takes a long-term view, smoothing out fluctuations in earnings, and the PEG ratio considers the company's expected growth rate. By using these different metrics, investors can gain a more comprehensive understanding of a company's valuation and make more informed investment decisions.

5. SUMMARY:
The classification system of price to earnings ratio includes trailing, forward, Shiller, and PEG ratios, each providing a unique perspective on a company's valuation and growth prospects.
