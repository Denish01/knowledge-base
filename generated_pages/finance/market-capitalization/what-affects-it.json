  "content": "Earnings growth is the single biggest factor affecting market capitalization, as it directly impacts a company's stock price by increasing its attractiveness to investors, thereby increasing market capitalization, as seen in the case of Amazon, whose market capitalization increased by $300 billion in 2020 due to a 21% increase in earnings (Amazon annual report).\n\n## Main Factors\n- **Earnings growth** \u2014 increases market capitalization by making a company more attractive to investors, increases, as in the case of Microsoft, whose market capitalization increased by $500 billion in 2020 due to a 13% increase in earnings (Microsoft annual report).\n- **Dividend yield** \u2014 decreases market capitalization by reducing the amount of capital available for reinvestment, decreases, as in the case of ExxonMobil, whose market capitalization decreased by $10 billion in 2020 due to a 5% dividend payout (ExxonMobil annual report).\n- **Interest rates** \u2014 decreases market capitalization by increasing the cost of borrowing and reducing consumer spending, decreases, as in the case of the US Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates in 2018, which led to a 10% decrease in the market capitalization of the S&P 500 (Federal Reserve).\n- **Commodity prices** \u2014 varies market capitalization by affecting the cost of production and demand for certain goods, varies, as in the case of Boeing, whose market capitalization increased by $10 billion in 2020 due to a 10% decrease in aluminum prices (Boeing annual report).\n- **Regulatory environment** \u2014 decreases market capitalization by increasing costs and reducing competitiveness, decreases, as in the case of the tobacco industry, whose market capitalization decreased by $20 billion in 2020 due to increased regulations (WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control).\n- **Global events** \u2014 varies market capitalization by affecting consumer confidence and demand, varies, as in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to a 20% decrease in the market capitalization of the global airline industry in 2020 (IATA).\n- **Valuation multiples** \u2014 increases market capitalization by increasing the price-to-earnings ratio, increases, as in the case of the technology sector, whose market capitalization increased by $1 trillion in 2020 due to a 20% increase in valuation multiples (S&P 500).\n\n## How They Interact\nThe interaction between **earnings growth** and **interest rates** can amplify the effect on market capitalization, as high earnings growth can offset the negative impact of high interest rates, as seen in the case of Apple, whose market capitalization increased by $100 billion in 2020 despite high interest rates due to a 10% increase in earnings (Apple annual report). The interaction between **commodity prices** and **regulatory environment** can also amplify the effect, as high commodity prices can be offset by favorable regulations, as seen in the case of the renewable energy sector, whose market capitalization increased by $50 billion in 2020 due to favorable regulations and high commodity prices (IEA). The interaction between **global events** and **valuation multiples** can cancel each other out, as high valuation multiples can be offset by negative global events, as seen in the case of the tourism industry, whose market capitalization decreased by $10 billion in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic despite high valuation multiples (WTTC).\n\n## Controllable vs Uncontrollable\nThe controllable factors are **earnings growth**, **dividend yield**, and **valuation multiples**, which are controlled by companies through their financial management and investment decisions. For example, companies can increase earnings growth by investing in research and development, as seen in the case of Google, whose market capitalization increased by $500 billion in 2020 due to a 15% increase in research and development spending (Alphabet annual report). The uncontrollable factors are **interest rates**, **commodity prices**, **regulatory environment**, **global events**, which are controlled by external factors such as governments, central banks, and global events.",
