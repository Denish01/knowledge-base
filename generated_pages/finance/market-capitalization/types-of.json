  "content": "There are four main categories of market capitalization, organized by the size of the companies' market value. \n**Large-cap** \u2014 companies with a market capitalization of $10 billion or more, characterized by high liquidity and stability, with Boeing being a notable example, producing ~800 aircraft annually (Boeing annual report). \n**Mid-cap** \u2014 companies with a market capitalization between $2 billion and $10 billion, distinguished by moderate growth rates and relatively lower volatility, with Whirlpool being a representative example, holding a significant share of the global home appliance market (Whirlpool annual report). \n**Small-cap** \u2014 companies with a market capitalization between $300 million and $2 billion, marked by higher growth potential and increased volatility, with Shopify being a prominent example, experiencing rapid expansion in the e-commerce platform market (Shopify annual report). \n**Micro-cap** \u2014 companies with a market capitalization below $300 million, characterized by limited liquidity and high risk, with Rocket Fuel being an example, having navigated the challenges of the digital advertising market (Rocket Fuel SEC filings).\n\n## Main Categories\n- **Large-cap** companies, such as Boeing, typically have a strong market presence, significant revenue, and a large customer base, which contributes to their stability and low volatility.\n- **Mid-cap** companies, such as Whirlpool, often experience moderate growth and may be in the process of expanding their market share or exploring new opportunities, making them attractive to investors seeking a balance between growth and stability.\n- **Small-cap** companies, such as Shopify, are frequently characterized by high growth rates and innovation, as they strive to establish themselves in their respective markets and expand their customer base.\n- **Micro-cap** companies, such as Rocket Fuel, face significant challenges due to their limited resources, high risk, and low liquidity, requiring careful management and strategic decision-making to navigate their markets.\n\n## Comparison Table\n| Category | Market Capitalization | Typical Volatility | Growth Potential |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Large-cap** | $10 billion+ | Low | Moderate |\n| **Mid-cap** | $2 billion - $10 billion | Moderate | Moderate |\n| **Small-cap** | $300 million - $2 billion | High | High |\n| **Micro-cap** | Below $300 million | Very High | Very High |\n\n## How They Relate\nThe categories of market capitalization often overlap or feed into each other as companies grow or decline. For example, a **small-cap** company like Shopify may become a **mid-cap** company as it expands its market share and increases its revenue. Conversely, a **large-cap** company like Boeing may be composed of multiple **small-cap** or **mid-cap** subsidiaries, each with its own distinct characteristics and growth potential. Specific pairs, such as **large-cap** and **mid-cap** companies, may be commonly confused due to their similar market presence, but they can be distinguished by their market capitalization and growth rates. The distinction between **small-cap** and **micro-cap** companies is also crucial, as **small-cap** companies are generally more established and less risky than **micro-cap** companies, which face significant challenges due to their limited resources and high volatility.",
