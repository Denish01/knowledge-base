# How Market Capitalization Works

Market capitalization is the process by which the total value of a company's outstanding shares is calculated, resulting in a publicly traded company's market value. The core cause-and-effect chain involves the multiplication of the total number of outstanding shares by the current market price of one share, producing a company's market capitalization.

## The Mechanism
The calculation of market capitalization is a straightforward process that involves multiplying the total number of outstanding shares by the current market price of one share. For example, if a company has 10 million outstanding shares and the current market price is $50 per share, the market capitalization would be $500 million.

## Step-by-step
1. The company's **outstanding shares** are calculated by adding the total number of shares issued to the public and the shares held by institutional investors, such as pension funds and mutual funds, resulting in a total of 10 million shares.
2. The **current market price** of one share is determined by the forces of supply and demand in the stock market, with the price fluctuating constantly, for instance, the current market price of Apple shares is around $150 (Apple annual report).
3. The market capitalization is calculated by multiplying the total number of outstanding shares by the current market price, resulting in a market capitalization of $1.5 billion for a company with 10 million outstanding shares and a market price of $150 per share.
4. The market capitalization is then used to determine the company's **market ranking**, with larger companies having a higher market capitalization, such as ExxonMobil with a market capitalization of over $500 billion (ExxonMobil annual report).
5. The market capitalization also affects the company's **weighting in stock market indexes**, such as the S&P 500, with companies having a higher market capitalization having a greater weighting in the index, for example, Apple has a weighting of around 7% in the S&P 500 (S&P Dow Jones Indices).
6. The market capitalization is also used by investors to determine the company's **size and risk profile**, with larger companies generally being considered less risky than smaller companies, such as the market capitalization of Boeing, which is around $200 billion (Boeing annual report).

## Key Components
- **Outstanding shares**: the total number of shares issued by the company and held by the public and institutional investors, which determines the company's market capitalization.
- **Current market price**: the price at which one share of the company's stock can be bought or sold, which fluctuates constantly and affects the company's market capitalization.
- **Market capitalization**: the total value of the company's outstanding shares, which is used to determine the company's market ranking and weighting in stock market indexes.
- **Stock market indexes**: such as the S&P 500, which track the performance of a basket of stocks and use market capitalization to determine the weighting of each company in the index.

## Common Questions
What happens if a company issues new shares? The company's market capitalization will increase if the new shares are issued at a price higher than the current market price, resulting in an increase in the company's market value. 
What is the difference between market capitalization and enterprise value? Market capitalization only takes into account the company's equity, while enterprise value also includes the company's debt, such as the enterprise value of General Electric, which is around $100 billion (General Electric annual report).
How does market capitalization affect a company's cost of capital? A company with a higher market capitalization generally has a lower cost of capital, as it is considered less risky by investors, such as the cost of capital for Microsoft, which is around 5% (Microsoft annual report).
What happens if a company's market capitalization decreases? A decrease in market capitalization can result in a decrease in the company's weighting in stock market indexes and a higher cost of capital, such as the decrease in market capitalization of Ford, which resulted in a decrease in its weighting in the S&P 500 (S&P Dow Jones Indices).
