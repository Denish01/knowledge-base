# What Market Capitalization Depends On

Market capitalization depends on **Revenue Streams**, as a company's ability to generate consistent revenue is crucial for determining its market value, and the absence of stable revenue streams can lead to significant market capitalization losses, as seen in the case of Kodak, which filed for bankruptcy in 2012 due to its inability to adapt to changing market conditions and generate sufficient revenue from its core business.

## Key Dependencies
- **Revenue Streams** — a company's ability to generate consistent revenue is crucial for determining its market value, and the absence of stable revenue streams can lead to significant market capitalization losses, as seen in the case of Kodak, which filed for bankruptcy in 2012 due to its inability to adapt to changing market conditions and generate sufficient revenue from its core business.
- **Earnings Per Share (EPS)** — a company's EPS is a critical factor in determining its market capitalization, as it reflects the company's profitability and ability to generate earnings for shareholders, and a decline in EPS can lead to a decrease in market capitalization, as seen in the case of General Electric, which experienced a significant decline in its market capitalization in 2017 due to a decline in its EPS.
- **Return on Equity (ROE)** — a company's ROE is a key metric for evaluating its financial performance and determining its market capitalization, as it reflects the company's ability to generate profits from shareholders' equity, and a low ROE can lead to a decrease in market capitalization, as seen in the case of Sears Holdings, which experienced a significant decline in its market capitalization in 2018 due to a low ROE.
- **Debt-to-Equity Ratio** — a company's debt-to-equity ratio is a critical factor in determining its market capitalization, as it reflects the company's level of indebtedness and ability to manage its debt, and a high debt-to-equity ratio can lead to a decrease in market capitalization, as seen in the case of Toys "R" Us, which filed for bankruptcy in 2017 due to a high debt-to-equity ratio.
- **Industry Growth** — a company's market capitalization is also dependent on the growth prospects of its industry, as a company operating in a declining industry is likely to experience a decrease in its market capitalization, as seen in the case of the coal industry, which has experienced significant declines in market capitalization in recent years due to declining demand and increasing competition from renewable energy sources.
- **Regulatory Environment** — a company's market capitalization can also be affected by changes in the regulatory environment, as new regulations or laws can impact a company's ability to operate and generate revenue, and a failure to comply with regulations can lead to significant fines and penalties, as seen in the case of Volkswagen, which faced significant fines and penalties in 2015 due to its failure to comply with emissions regulations.

## Priority Order
The dependencies can be ranked in order of priority as follows:
- **Revenue Streams**: the most critical dependency, as a company's ability to generate revenue is essential for its survival and growth.
- **Earnings Per Share (EPS)**: the second most critical dependency, as a company's EPS is a key metric for evaluating its financial performance and determining its market capitalization.
- **Return on Equity (ROE)**: the third most critical dependency, as a company's ROE is a key metric for evaluating its financial performance and determining its market capitalization.
- **Debt-to-Equity Ratio**: the fourth most critical dependency, as a company's debt-to-equity ratio is a critical factor in determining its market capitalization.
- **Industry Growth**: the fifth most critical dependency, as a company's market capitalization is also dependent on the growth prospects of its industry.
- **Regulatory Environment**: the sixth most critical dependency, as a company's market capitalization can also be affected by changes in the regulatory environment.

## Common Gaps
One common gap in evaluating market capitalization is the assumption that a company's market capitalization is solely dependent on its financial performance, and that other factors such as industry growth and regulatory environment are not as critical. However, this assumption can lead to significant errors in evaluating a company's market capitalization, as changes in industry growth and regulatory environment can have a significant impact on a company's market capitalization, as seen in the case of the coal industry, which has experienced significant declines in market capitalization in recent years due to declining demand and increasing competition from renewable energy sources.
