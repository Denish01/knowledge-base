  "content": "Bond yield is a **return on investment** that reflects the relationship between a bond's **coupon rate**, **time to maturity**, and **market price**, with higher yields indicating higher returns and lower prices.\n\n## The Mechanism\nThe bond yield mechanism involves the interaction of **interest rates**, **inflation expectations**, and **credit risk**, which influence the **market price** of a bond and ultimately determine its yield. As interest rates rise, the market price of a bond falls, increasing its yield to attract investors, as seen in the **yield curve** model.\n\n## Step-by-Step\n1. When a bond is issued, its **face value** and **coupon rate** are set, determining the annual **interest payments** to be made to the bondholder, such as the 10-year US Treasury bond with a 2% coupon rate.\n2. As market conditions change, the bond's **market price** fluctuates in response to **interest rate** movements, with a 1% increase in interest rates causing a 10% decrease in the bond's price, according to **duration** calculations.\n3. The **yield to maturity** is calculated by taking into account the bond's **coupon payments**, **time to maturity**, and **market price**, resulting in a yield of around 4% for a 10-year bond with a 3% coupon rate and a market price of 90% of its face value.\n4. As **inflation expectations** rise, investors demand higher yields to compensate for the expected loss of purchasing power, such as the 6% yield on a 10-year bond during periods of high inflation.\n5. The **credit risk** of the bond issuer also affects the yield, with higher-risk issuers offering higher yields to attract investors, such as the 8% yield on a high-yield corporate bond.\n6. The **yield curve** is shaped by the interaction of these factors, with shorter-term bonds typically offering lower yields than longer-term bonds, as seen in the **term structure** of interest rates.\n\n## Key Components\n- **Coupon rate**: the interest rate paid periodically to the bondholder, which affects the bond's yield and attractiveness to investors.\n- **Time to maturity**: the length of time until the bond expires, which influences the bond's **duration** and sensitivity to interest rate changes.\n- **Market price**: the current price of the bond in the market, which is determined by the interaction of supply and demand forces.\n- **Credit risk**: the likelihood of the bond issuer defaulting on its obligations, which affects the bond's yield and attractiveness to investors.\n\n## Common Questions\nWhat happens if interest rates rise? When interest rates rise, the market price of a bond falls, increasing its yield to attract investors, such as the 20% decrease in bond prices that occurred during the 1994 interest rate hike.\nHow does inflation affect bond yields? As inflation expectations rise, investors demand higher yields to compensate for the expected loss of purchasing power, such as the 4% increase in yields that occurred during the 1970s inflationary period.\nWhat is the relationship between bond yield and credit risk? The credit risk of the bond issuer affects the yield, with higher-risk issuers offering higher yields to attract investors, such as the 10% yield on a junk bond.\nHow does the yield curve affect bond investing? The yield curve influences the **term structure** of interest rates, with shorter-term bonds typically offering lower yields than longer-term bonds, such as the 2% yield on a 2-year Treasury bond versus the 4% yield on a 10-year Treasury bond.",
