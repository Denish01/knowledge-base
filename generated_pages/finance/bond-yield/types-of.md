# Types of Bond Yield

There are several types of bond yield, categorized into six main groups based on the calculation method and characteristics: **Nominal Yield**, **Current Yield**, **Yield to Maturity**, **Yield to Call**, **Real Yield**, and **Effective Yield**.

## Main Categories
- **Nominal Yield** — the interest rate paid on a bond's face value, distinguishing it from other yields by being the simplest to calculate, as seen in the 10-year US Treasury bond with a nominal yield of 2%.
- **Current Yield** — the annual interest payment divided by the bond's current market price, providing a snapshot of the bond's current income generation, such as the 4% current yield on a Johnson & Johnson bond trading at a premium.
- **Yield to Maturity** — the total return anticipated on a bond if it is held until the maturity date, accounting for interest payments, capital gains, or losses, exemplified by the 7% yield to maturity on a newly issued Coca-Cola bond.
- **Yield to Call** — the yield calculated when a bond is called before its maturity date, reflecting the impact of early redemption on the bond's overall return, as illustrated by the 5% yield to call on a Ford Motor Company bond callable in five years.
- **Real Yield** — the yield adjusted for inflation, giving a clearer picture of the bond's purchasing power, such as the 1% real yield on a Treasury Inflation-Protected Security (TIPS) during a period of 2% inflation.
- **Effective Yield** — the yield that reflects the compounding effect of reinvesting interest payments, crucial for bonds with high coupon rates or long maturities, demonstrated by the 8% effective yield on a 30-year Mexican government bond with semiannual coupon payments.

## Comparison Table
| Bond Yield Type | Calculation Basis | Sensitivity to Interest Rates | Typical Investor |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Nominal Yield | Face value and coupon rate | Low | Institutional investors |
| Current Yield | Market price and annual interest | Medium | Income-focused investors |
| Yield to Maturity | Face value, coupon rate, time to maturity | High | Long-term investors |
| Yield to Call | Face value, coupon rate, call date | Medium | Investors anticipating early redemption |
| Real Yield | Nominal yield adjusted for inflation | High | Inflation-protected investors |
| Effective Yield | Compounded interest payments | High | Investors seeking long-term growth |

## How They Relate
The categories of bond yield often overlap or are commonly confused, particularly between **Yield to Maturity** and **Yield to Call**, as both consider the time value of money but differ in their assumptions about the bond's redemption. **Nominal Yield** and **Current Yield** are sometimes mistakenly used interchangeably, despite the former being a fixed rate and the latter reflecting market price fluctuations. **Real Yield** and **Effective Yield** both provide more nuanced views of a bond's return but are distinct in their adjustments for inflation and compounding, respectively. Understanding these distinctions is crucial for investors to make informed decisions about their bond portfolios, such as the choice between a **Nominal Yield**-focused strategy for a **Current Yield**-oriented approach, depending on their investment goals and market expectations.
