# What is Types Of Bond Yield?

## INTRODUCTION
The concept of bond yield is crucial in understanding the performance and value of bonds, which are debt securities issued by entities to raise capital. Bond yield refers to the return an investor can expect from a bond, taking into account the interest payments and the capital gain or loss when the bond matures. The classification of bond yield types is essential because it helps investors, financial analysts, and economists understand the various ways bond yields can be calculated and interpreted, thereby facilitating informed decision-making in the bond market. By categorizing bond yields, individuals can better analyze the risks, returns, and characteristics of different bonds, which is vital for portfolio management and financial planning.

## MAIN CATEGORIES
1. **Nominal Yield**
   - Definition: Nominal yield, also known as the coupon yield, is the interest rate that a bond's issuer agrees to pay periodically until the bond reaches maturity. It represents the annual interest payment as a percentage of the bond's face value.
   - Key Characteristics: Fixed interest rate, periodic payments, face value.
   - Example: A bond with a face value of $1,000 and a nominal yield of 5% will pay $50 in interest annually.

2. **Current Yield**
   - Definition: Current yield is the annual interest payment divided by the bond's current market price, rather than its face value. It reflects the return an investor can expect if they buy the bond at its current market price.
   - Key Characteristics: Market price, annual interest payment, reflects current market conditions.
   - Example: If a bond with a face value of $1,000 and a 5% nominal yield is selling for $900, its current yield would be higher than 5% because the same $50 interest payment is now divided by a lower price.

3. **Yield to Maturity (YTM)**
   - Definition: Yield to maturity is the total return an investor can expect from a bond if they hold it until maturity, including both interest payments and any capital gain or loss from the difference between the purchase price and the face value.
   - Key Characteristics: Takes into account all cash flows, including return of principal, reflects total return.
   - Example: If an investor buys a bond for $900 that matures at $1,000 with a 5% nominal yield, the YTM will account for both the interest payments and the $100 capital gain at maturity.

4. **Yield to Call (YTC)**
   - Definition: Yield to call is similar to YTM but is used for bonds that have a call feature, which allows the issuer to redeem the bond before maturity. YTC calculates the return if the bond is called at the earliest possible call date.
   - Key Characteristics: Applies to callable bonds, considers the call price and the earliest call date.
   - Example: For a bond with a face value of $1,000, a call price of $1,050, and a nominal yield of 5%, the YTC would calculate the return assuming the bond is redeemed at the call price on the earliest call date.

## COMPARISON TABLE
| Type of Yield | Calculation Basis | Characteristics |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Nominal Yield | Face Value | Fixed, periodic interest |
| Current Yield | Market Price | Reflects current market conditions |
| Yield to Maturity (YTM) | All Cash Flows to Maturity | Total return, including capital gain/loss |
| Yield to Call (YTC) | Call Price and Earliest Call Date | Applies to callable bonds, considers call feature |

## HOW THEY RELATE
These categories of bond yield are interconnected as they all relate to the return on investment for bonds, but they differ in what they measure and how they are calculated. Nominal yield provides a basic understanding of the bond's interest payment. Current yield gives insight into the bond's value in the current market. Yield to maturity and yield to call offer a more comprehensive view of the total return an investor can expect, with YTM applicable to all bonds and YTC specifically relevant to callable bonds. Understanding the differences between these yield types is crucial for making informed investment decisions.

## SUMMARY
The classification system of bond yield includes nominal yield, current yield, yield to maturity, and yield to call, each providing unique insights into the return on investment for bonds based on different calculation bases and characteristics.
