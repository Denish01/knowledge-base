# What Bond Yield Depends On

Bond yield depends on **Interest Rates**, as changes in interest rates directly impact the attractiveness of existing bonds, with higher interest rates reducing the value of older bonds with lower yields, as seen in the 1994 bond market crisis when a sudden increase in interest rates led to a significant decline in bond prices.

## Key Dependencies
- **Interest Rates** — fluctuations in interest rates affect bond yields, and a failure to account for interest rate changes can lead to significant losses, as witnessed in the 1994 bond market crisis.
- **Inflation Expectations** — rising inflation expectations can lead to higher bond yields, and neglecting to consider inflation expectations can result in incorrect yield assessments, such as the surprise inflation spike in 1970s United States that caught bond investors off guard.
- **Credit Risk** — bonds with higher credit risk typically offer higher yields to compensate investors for the increased risk of default, and underestimating credit risk can lead to significant losses, as seen in the 2008 financial crisis when many investors underestimated the credit risk of mortgage-backed securities.
- **Liquidity** — bonds with lower liquidity typically offer higher yields to compensate investors for the reduced ability to quickly buy or sell the bond, and a lack of liquidity can lead to significant price volatility, as experienced by investors in the Greek government bond market in 2015.
- **Taxation** — tax policies can impact bond yields, and a failure to consider tax implications can lead to incorrect yield assessments, such as the impact of the 1986 Tax Reform Act in the United States, which changed the tax treatment of bond income and affected bond yields.
- **Monetary Policy** — central bank actions, such as quantitative easing, can impact bond yields, and neglecting to consider monetary policy can result in incorrect yield assessments, as seen in the European Central Bank's quantitative easing program in 2015, which led to significant changes in bond yields.

## Priority Order
Ranking the dependencies from most to least critical:
- **Interest Rates** — most critical, as changes in interest rates have a direct and immediate impact on bond yields.
- **Inflation Expectations** — second most critical, as rising inflation expectations can lead to higher bond yields and significant losses if not accounted for.
- **Credit Risk** — third most critical, as underestimating credit risk can lead to significant losses, as seen in the 2008 financial crisis.
- **Liquidity** — fourth most critical, as a lack of liquidity can lead to significant price volatility, but is generally less critical than interest rates, inflation expectations, and credit risk.
- **Taxation** — fifth most critical, as tax policies can impact bond yields, but is generally less critical than the other dependencies.
- **Monetary Policy** — least critical, as while central bank actions can impact bond yields, their effects are often more indirect and less immediate than the other dependencies.

## Common Gaps
People often overlook the impact of **Liquidity** on bond yields, assuming that all bonds are highly liquid and can be quickly bought or sold, but this assumption can lead to significant price volatility and losses, as experienced by investors in the Greek government bond market in 2015. Another common gap is underestimating the impact of **Credit Risk**, assuming that all bonds are low-risk and will not default, but this assumption can lead to significant losses, as seen in the 2008 financial crisis.
