# Common Misconceptions About Annual Percentage Rate

The most common misconception about annual percentage rate (APR) is that it is the same as the interest rate, which is not the case, as APR takes into account fees and compound interest, with the Truth in Lending Act requiring lenders to disclose APR to borrowers (Federal Reserve).

## Misconceptions
- **Myth:** Annual percentage rate is only used for credit cards and loans.
- **Fact:** APR is also used for savings accounts and investments, such as certificates of deposit, which can have an APR of around 2% (Bankrate), and money market accounts, which can have an APR of around 1.5% (NerdWallet).
- **Source of confusion:** The widespread media narrative that APR is solely a borrowing concept, rather than a broader financial metric, as seen in personal finance textbooks like "The Total Money Makeover" by Dave Ramsey.
- **Myth:** APR is always higher than the interest rate.
- **Fact:** In some cases, such as with simple interest loans, the APR can be equal to the interest rate, as explained by economists like **Fisher**, who developed the theory of interest (Fisher, 1930).
- **Source of confusion:** The common assumption that all loans have compound interest, which is not the case, as some loans have simple interest, such as some personal loans from lenders like LendingClub.
- **Myth:** APR is a fixed rate that never changes.
- **Fact:** APR can change over time, such as with variable-rate credit cards, which can have an APR of 18% or more (CreditCards.com), and adjustable-rate mortgages, which can have an APR of around 4% (Zillow).
- **Source of confusion:** The misleading language used by some lenders, which can make it seem like the APR is fixed when it is actually variable, as seen in the fine print of credit card agreements.
- **Myth:** APR is the only factor to consider when choosing a loan or credit card.
- **Fact:** Other factors, such as fees, repayment terms, and credit limits, can be just as important as APR, as explained by the **Federal Trade Commission**, which provides guidance on choosing credit cards (Federal Trade Commission).
- **Source of confusion:** The oversimplification of financial decisions in the media, which can lead consumers to focus solely on APR when making financial decisions, as seen in articles like "The Best Credit Cards for Bad Credit" by Credit Karma.
- **Myth:** APR is only relevant for consumers, not businesses.
- **Fact:** Businesses also need to consider APR when taking out loans or using credit cards, as explained by the **Small Business Administration**, which provides guidance on small business financing (Small Business Administration).
- **Source of confusion:** The common assumption that businesses have access to more complex and favorable financing options, which is not always the case, as seen in the challenges faced by small businesses in securing loans.
- **Myth:** APR is a measure of the total cost of a loan.
- **Fact:** APR does not take into account all costs associated with a loan, such as origination fees and late payment fees, which can add up to 5% or more of the loan amount (LendingTree).
- **Source of confusion:** The misleading language used by some lenders, which can make it seem like APR is a comprehensive measure of the total cost of a loan when it is not, as seen in the fine print of loan agreements.
