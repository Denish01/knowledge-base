  "content": "The **annual percentage rate (APR)** depends on the **borrower's credit score**, as a low credit score can lead to a higher APR, resulting in increased interest payments, as seen in the case of subprime mortgage borrowers in the 2008 financial crisis, where low credit scores led to APRs as high as 18%, causing widespread defaults.\n\n## Key Dependencies\n- **Borrower's credit score** \u2014 a low credit score can lead to a higher APR, resulting in increased interest payments, as seen in the case of subprime mortgage borrowers in the 2008 financial crisis, where low credit scores led to APRs as high as 18%, causing widespread defaults.\n- **Loan amount** \u2014 larger loan amounts often result in higher APRs, as lenders perceive them as riskier, as seen in the case of jumbo mortgages, where loan amounts above $500,000 can result in APRs 1-2% higher than smaller loans.\n- **Repayment term** \u2014 longer repayment terms often result in higher APRs, as lenders are exposed to more risk over a longer period, as seen in the case of 30-year mortgages, where APRs are often 0.5-1% higher than 15-year mortgages.\n- **Collateral** \u2014 lack of collateral can lead to higher APRs, as lenders perceive unsecured loans as riskier, as seen in the case of credit card debt, where APRs can be as high as 30% due to the lack of collateral.\n- **Market conditions** \u2014 changes in market conditions, such as inflation or economic downturns, can lead to higher APRs, as lenders adjust their interest rates to reflect the increased risk, as seen in the case of the 1980s, where high inflation led to APRs above 20%.\n\n## Priority Order\nThe dependencies can be ranked from most to least critical as follows:\n- **Borrower's credit score**, as it has the most direct impact on the APR, with even small changes in credit score resulting in significant changes in APR.\n- **Loan amount**, as larger loans are often perceived as riskier, resulting in higher APRs.\n- **Repayment term**, as longer repayment terms expose lenders to more risk, resulting in higher APRs.\n- **Collateral**, as lack of collateral increases the risk for lenders, resulting in higher APRs.\n- **Market conditions**, as changes in market conditions can have a significant impact on APRs, but are often outside the control of the borrower.\n\n## Common Gaps\nPeople often overlook the assumption that **interest rates are fixed**, which can lead to unexpected increases in APRs if market conditions change, as seen in the case of adjustable-rate mortgages, where borrowers may assume their interest rate is fixed, but it can actually increase significantly if market conditions change, leading to unaffordable payments.",
