  "content": "There are four main categories of **Annual Percentage Rate (APR)**, organized by the type of interest rate and the borrowing product to which it applies. \n\n## Main Categories\n- **Nominal APR** \u2014 the simplest form of APR, calculated as the interest rate per period multiplied by the number of periods per year, with a concrete example being a credit card with a nominal APR of 20% (HSBC UK).\n- **Effective APR** \u2014 takes into account compounding interest, reflecting the true cost of borrowing over a year, with a concrete example being a loan from Lloyds Bank with an effective APR of 25%.\n- **Tiered APR** \u2014 applies different interest rates to different tiers of borrowing, with a concrete example being a tiered APR structure used by American Express for its credit cards, where balances below $1,000 have an APR of 18% and balances above $1,000 have an APR of 22%.\n- **Introductory APR** \u2014 a promotional APR offered for a limited time, often 0%, with a concrete example being a 0% introductory APR for 12 months offered by Barclays on its credit cards.\n\n## Comparison Table\n| Category | Cost | Scale | Speed |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Nominal APR | Lower | Small to medium | Fast |\n| Effective APR | Higher | Medium to large | Medium |\n| Tiered APR | Variable | Large | Slow |\n| Introductory APR | Zero or low | Small | Fast |\n\n## How They Relate\nThe categories of APR overlap in several ways, with **Nominal APR** and **Effective APR** both being used to calculate the interest rate on borrowing products, but with **Effective APR** providing a more accurate picture of the true cost of borrowing. **Tiered APR** structures often use **Nominal APR** as the base rate, with higher tiers having higher APRs. **Introductory APR** offers are often used to attract new customers, but after the introductory period ends, the **Nominal APR** or **Effective APR** applies. Specific pairs of categories are commonly confused, such as **Nominal APR** and **Effective APR**, which are often used interchangeably but have distinct calculations and implications for borrowers. Additionally, **Tiered APR** and **Introductory APR** can be confused, as both involve multiple interest rates, but **Tiered APR** applies to different tiers of borrowing, while **Introductory APR** applies for a limited time.",
