  "content": "## Definition\nAnnual Percentage Rate (APR) refers to the interest rate charged on a loan or credit product over a year, taking into account fees and compound interest, as outlined in the Truth in Lending Act of 1968.\n\n## How It Works\nThe APR is calculated by considering the nominal interest rate, fees, and compounding frequency, with the **effective annual rate** being the result of this calculation. For instance, if a credit card has a nominal interest rate of 18% and a compounding frequency of monthly, the APR would be higher than 18% due to the effects of compounding. The **usury laws**, which regulate the maximum allowable interest rates, also influence the APR, with some states capping the APR at 36% (National Conference of State Legislatures).\n\nThe APR is influenced by the **type of loan**, with mortgages and auto loans typically having lower APRs than credit cards and personal loans. For example, a 30-year mortgage might have an APR of 4% (Freddie Mac), while a credit card might have an APR of 25% (CreditCards.com). The **loan term** also affects the APR, with longer loan terms resulting in higher total interest paid over the life of the loan. According to the **time value of money** principle, a dollar received today is worth more than a dollar received in the future, making the APR a critical factor in loan decisions.\n\nThe APR can also be affected by **macroeconomic factors**, such as inflation and monetary policy. For instance, during periods of high inflation, lenders may increase the APR to keep pace with the rising cost of living. The **prime rate**, set by the Federal Reserve, also influences the APR, with changes in the prime rate trickling down to consumer loan rates. As of 2022, the prime rate is 4.75% (Federal Reserve), which has led to higher APRs for many types of loans.\n\n## Key Components\n- **Nominal interest rate**: the base interest rate of the loan, which is used as a starting point for calculating the APR. An increase in the nominal interest rate will result in a higher APR.\n- **Fees**: charges associated with the loan, such as origination fees or late payment fees, which are factored into the APR calculation. Higher fees will increase the APR.\n- **Compounding frequency**: the number of times interest is compounded per year, which affects the APR. More frequent compounding will result in a higher APR.\n- **Loan term**: the length of time the borrower has to repay the loan, which influences the total interest paid over the life of the loan. Longer loan terms will result in higher total interest paid.\n- **Credit score**: the borrower's creditworthiness, which affects the APR offered by the lender. A higher credit score will typically result in a lower APR.\n- **Market conditions**: the state of the economy and financial markets, which can impact the APR. For example, during times of economic uncertainty, lenders may increase the APR to reflect the higher risk.\n\n## Common Misconceptions\n**Myth:** The APR is always the same as the nominal interest rate \u2014 **Fact:** The APR takes into account fees and compounding interest, making it a more comprehensive measure of the loan's cost (Truth in Lending Act of 1968). \n**Myth:** A low APR is always the best option \u2014 **Fact:** A low APR may come with higher fees or other unfavorable terms, making it essential to consider the total cost of the loan (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau). \n**Myth:** The APR is fixed for the life of the loan \u2014 **Fact:** Some loans, such as adjustable-rate mortgages, have APRs that can change over time based on market conditions (Federal Reserve).\n\n## In Practice\nIn 2022, Wells Fargo offered a 30-year mortgage with an APR of 4.25% (Wells Fargo), while Discover offered a credit card with an APR of 22.99% (Discover). These APRs reflect the different levels of risk associated with each type of loan, as well as the varying fees and compounding frequencies. For instance, the mortgage has a lower APR due to the lower risk of default and the longer loan term, which allows the lender to earn interest over a more extended period. In contrast, the credit card has a higher APR due to the higher risk of default and the shorter loan term, which requires the lender to charge higher interest rates to compensate for the increased risk.",
