  "content": "## Definition\nAnnual Percentage Rate (APR) is a measure of the total cost of credit, including interest and fees, expressed as a yearly rate, first introduced by the Truth in Lending Act of 1968.\n\n## How It Works\nThe APR calculation takes into account the nominal interest rate, compounding frequency, and fees associated with a loan or credit product. For instance, a credit card with a nominal interest rate of 18% and an annual fee of $50 would have a higher APR than one with the same interest rate but no fees. The APR is calculated by dividing the total interest and fees paid over a year by the principal amount borrowed, then multiplying by 100 to express it as a percentage. According to **Ricardo's comparative advantage model, 1817**, lenders use APR to determine the profitability of their loan portfolios.\n\nThe APR is also influenced by the compounding frequency, which can range from daily to annually. A higher compounding frequency results in a higher APR, as interest is accrued more frequently. For example, a loan with a nominal interest rate of 10% compounded daily would have a higher APR than one with the same interest rate compounded annually. The **time value of money**, a concept developed by economists such as **Eugen von B\u00f6hm-Bawerk**, plays a significant role in determining the APR, as it takes into account the present value of future cash flows.\n\nThe APR is used by lenders to compare the profitability of different loan products and by borrowers to evaluate the cost of credit. A lower APR indicates a lower cost of credit, while a higher APR indicates a higher cost. For instance, **Boeing** offers financing options to its customers with APRs ranging from 5% to 15% (Boeing annual report), depending on the type of loan and the borrower's creditworthiness.\n\n## Key Components\n- **Nominal interest rate**: the base interest rate of a loan, which is used to calculate the APR. An increase in the nominal interest rate results in a higher APR, while a decrease results in a lower APR.\n- **Compounding frequency**: the frequency at which interest is accrued, which can range from daily to annually. A higher compounding frequency results in a higher APR, while a lower compounding frequency results in a lower APR.\n- **Fees**: charges associated with a loan or credit product, such as origination fees or late payment fees. An increase in fees results in a higher APR, while a decrease in fees results in a lower APR.\n- **Loan term**: the length of time over which a loan is repaid, which can range from a few months to several years. A longer loan term results in a lower APR, while a shorter loan term results in a higher APR.\n- **Credit score**: a measure of a borrower's creditworthiness, which can affect the APR offered by a lender. A higher credit score results in a lower APR, while a lower credit score results in a higher APR.\n\n## Common Misconceptions\n**Myth:** APR is the same as the nominal interest rate \u2014 **Fact:** APR takes into account fees and compounding frequency, in addition to the nominal interest rate (Truth in Lending Act of 1968).\n**Myth:** A lower APR always results in a lower cost of credit \u2014 **Fact:** A lower APR may not always result in a lower cost of credit, as other factors such as fees and loan term can affect the total cost (Boeing annual report).\n**Myth:** APR is only used by lenders \u2014 **Fact:** Borrowers also use APR to evaluate the cost of credit and compare different loan products (Ricardo's comparative advantage model, 1817).\n**Myth:** APR is a fixed rate \u2014 **Fact:** APR can vary over time, as lenders may adjust the interest rate or fees associated with a loan (Eugen von B\u00f6hm-Bawerk's time value of money concept).\n\n## In Practice\nIn the United States, the **Federal Reserve** sets monetary policy, which can affect the APR offered by lenders. For example, in 2020, the Federal Reserve lowered the federal funds rate to 0.25% (Federal Reserve), resulting in lower APRs for borrowers. **Wells Fargo**, a major US bank, offers a range of loan products with APRs ranging from 5% to 20% (Wells Fargo annual report), depending on the type of loan and the borrower's creditworthiness. A borrower with a good credit score may qualify for a loan with an APR of 6%, while a borrower with a poor credit score may be offered a loan with an APR of 18%.",
