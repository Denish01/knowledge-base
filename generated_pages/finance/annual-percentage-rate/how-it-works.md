# How Annual Percentage Rate Works

The **annual percentage rate (APR)** is a mechanism that calculates the total cost of borrowing by taking into account the interest rate and fees associated with a loan, producing an annualized rate that reflects the true cost of borrowing. The APR is calculated by considering the principal amount, interest rate, and fees, and then expressing the total cost as a percentage of the principal amount over a year.

## The Mechanism
The core cause-and-effect chain of the APR mechanism involves the lender charging interest on the principal amount, which increases the total amount owed, and then expressing this total amount as a percentage of the principal amount over a year. The APR is calculated using a formula that takes into account the interest rate, fees, and compounding frequency, producing an annualized rate that reflects the true cost of borrowing.

## Step-by-Step
1. The lender charges interest on the principal amount, typically expressed as a **nominal interest rate**, which is the rate charged on the loan without considering compounding, resulting in an increase in the total amount owed, for example, a $1,000 loan with a 10% nominal interest rate would accrue $100 in interest over a year.
2. The lender may also charge fees, such as **origination fees** or **late payment fees**, which are added to the total amount owed, increasing the total cost of borrowing, for instance, a $1,000 loan with a 10% nominal interest rate and a 2% origination fee would result in a total amount owed of $1,020.
3. The total amount owed is then expressed as a percentage of the principal amount over a year, using a formula that takes into account the interest rate, fees, and **compounding frequency**, resulting in an APR of 12.68% for the example loan, assuming monthly compounding.
4. The APR is calculated using a formula that considers the **effective interest rate**, which is the rate that reflects the effects of compounding, and the fees associated with the loan, producing an APR that is higher than the nominal interest rate, for example, a loan with a 10% nominal interest rate and monthly compounding would have an effective interest rate of 10.47%.
5. The lender discloses the APR to the borrower, who can then use this information to compare the cost of different loan options, for instance, a borrower considering a loan with an APR of 12.68% versus one with an APR of 15.24% would choose the former as it represents a lower cost of borrowing.
6. The borrower repays the loan, and the lender earns interest and fees, which are calculated based on the APR, resulting in a total revenue of $126.80 for the lender over a year, assuming the example loan is repaid in equal monthly installments.

## Key Components
- **Interest rate**: the rate charged on the loan, which increases the total amount owed, and is a critical component of the APR calculation, as it determines the amount of interest accrued over a year.
- **Fees**: charges associated with the loan, such as origination fees or late payment fees, which increase the total cost of borrowing, and are added to the total amount owed.
- **Compounding frequency**: the frequency at which interest is compounded, which affects the effective interest rate and the APR, for example, monthly compounding results in a higher APR than annual compounding.
- **Principal amount**: the initial amount borrowed, which serves as the base for calculating the APR, and is used to determine the total amount owed.

## Common Questions
What happens if the lender fails to disclose the APR? The borrower may not be aware of the true cost of borrowing, and may be subject to **usury laws**, which regulate the maximum interest rate that can be charged on a loan. 
What is the difference between the APR and the **annual equivalent rate (AER)**? The APR takes into account fees and compounding frequency, while the AER only considers the interest rate, resulting in a lower rate for the AER, for example, a loan with an APR of 12.68% may have an AER of 10%. 
How does the APR affect the total cost of borrowing? The APR determines the total amount owed over a year, and a higher APR results in a higher total cost of borrowing, for instance, a loan with an APR of 15.24% would result in a higher total cost of borrowing than a loan with an APR of 12.68%. 
What is the purpose of the **Truth in Lending Act (TILA)**? The TILA requires lenders to disclose the APR and other terms of the loan to the borrower, providing transparency and protection for the borrower, and ensuring that lenders comply with usury laws and other regulations.
