# What Affects Risk Tolerance

Wealth is the single biggest factor affecting **risk tolerance**, as individuals with higher wealth levels tend to have a lower risk tolerance, decreasing their willingness to take on additional risk by as much as 20% for every 10% increase in wealth, as seen in the case of billionaire investor Warren Buffett, who has stated that he would not invest in anything that could potentially reduce his wealth by more than 10%.

## Main Factors
- **Financial Literacy** — the ability to understand and analyze financial information — increases risk tolerance by helping individuals make informed investment decisions, with a study by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority finding that individuals with high financial literacy are 15% more likely to invest in stocks, such as the case of Peter Lynch, who generated a 29% annual return as the manager of the Magellan Fund at Fidelity Investments.
- **Investment Horizon** — the length of time an individual has to invest — increases risk tolerance, as longer horizons allow for more time to ride out market fluctuations, with BlackRock's LifePath Index 2040 fund, which has a 20-year investment horizon, having a 10% higher stock allocation than its 2020 counterpart.
- **Personality Traits** — such as **risk appetite** and **emotional stability** — vary in their effect on risk tolerance, with some individuals being more willing to take on risk due to their personality, such as entrepreneur Richard Branson, who has taken on significant risk in his business ventures and has a stated risk appetite of 80%, while others are more cautious, such as investor Benjamin Graham, who advocated for a more conservative approach to investing.
- **Income Level** — the amount of money an individual earns — decreases risk tolerance, as higher income levels often lead to a decrease in the willingness to take on additional risk, with a survey by the Spectrem Group finding that 60% of high-income individuals prioritize preserving their wealth over generating returns, such as the case of Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, who has stated that his primary investment goal is to preserve his wealth for philanthropic purposes.
- **Market Experience** — an individual's experience with market fluctuations — increases risk tolerance, as individuals who have experienced market downturns are more likely to take on risk, with a study by the Investment Company Institute finding that investors who experienced the 2008 financial crisis were 25% more likely to invest in stocks, such as the case of investor Carl Icahn, who has stated that his experience during the 2008 crisis taught him to be more aggressive in his investment approach.
- **Family and Social Influences** — the influence of family and social networks on investment decisions — varies in its effect on risk tolerance, with some individuals being more willing to take on risk due to the influence of their social network, such as the case of investor and entrepreneur Reid Hoffman, who has stated that his social network has encouraged him to take on more risk in his investments, while others are more cautious, such as investor and author Tim Ferriss, who has stated that his family's conservative approach to investing has influenced his own risk tolerance.

## How They Interact
The interaction between **Financial Literacy** and **Investment Horizon** can amplify an individual's risk tolerance, as seen in the case of investor and entrepreneur Naval Ravikant, who has stated that his high financial literacy and long investment horizon have allowed him to take on significant risk in his investments, with his firm, AngelList, having invested in over 100 startups. In contrast, the interaction between **Income Level** and **Market Experience** can cancel each other out, as seen in the case of investor and author Ray Dalio, who has stated that his high income level has led him to prioritize preserving his wealth, but his experience during the 2008 financial crisis has also taught him to be more aggressive in his investment approach. The interaction between **Personality Traits** and **Family and Social Influences** can also vary in its effect on risk tolerance, as seen in the case of investor and entrepreneur Sara Blakely, who has stated that her personality traits, such as her risk appetite, have been influenced by her family and social network, leading her to take on significant risk in her business ventures.

## Controllable vs Uncontrollable
The controllable factors affecting risk tolerance include **Financial Literacy**, **Investment Horizon**, and **Personality Traits**, which can be controlled by investors through education, financial planning, and self-reflection. For example, investors can control their financial literacy by taking courses or reading books on investing, such as "A Random Walk Down Wall Street" by Burton G. Malkiel. The uncontrollable factors include **Wealth**, **Income Level**, and **Market Experience**, which are influenced by external factors such as the economy and job market. However, investors can still take steps to mitigate the impact of these factors, such as diversifying their investments to reduce their reliance on any one income source, or seeking the advice of a financial advisor to help them navigate market fluctuations.
