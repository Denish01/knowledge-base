  "content": "Financial literacy is the most critical dependency for **risk tolerance**, as it directly affects an individual's ability to understand and navigate complex financial decisions, with the lack of financial literacy contributing to the 2008 financial crisis, where many homeowners took on mortgages they could not afford.\n\n## Key Dependencies\n- **Financial literacy** \u2014 required to understand financial markets and make informed decisions, without which investors may fall prey to fraudulent schemes, as seen in the case of Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme, which resulted in billions of dollars in losses for unsuspecting investors.\n- **Investment goals** \u2014 necessary to determine the appropriate level of risk, as failing to define clear goals can lead to poor investment choices, such as the case of the Norwegian Government Pension Fund, which faced criticism for its investment in companies with questionable environmental records.\n- **Time horizon** \u2014 crucial in determining the ability to withstand market fluctuations, as a short time horizon can lead to significant losses, as seen in the case of the 2020 stock market crash, where investors with a short time horizon were forced to sell their assets at a loss.\n- **Diversification** \u2014 essential to minimize risk, as a lack of diversification can lead to significant losses, such as the case of the Enron scandal, where employees who had their retirement savings invested solely in Enron stock lost everything.\n- **Risk assessment** \u2014 necessary to evaluate potential risks and rewards, without which investors may take on excessive risk, as seen in the case of the 2007 subprime mortgage crisis, where lenders failed to properly assess the risk of subprime loans.\n\n## Priority Order\nThe dependencies can be ranked in the following order:\n- **Financial literacy**, as it is the foundation for making informed investment decisions\n- **Investment goals**, as they determine the appropriate level of risk\n- **Time horizon**, as it affects the ability to withstand market fluctuations\n- **Diversification**, as it minimizes risk\n- **Risk assessment**, as it evaluates potential risks and rewards, with the ranking justified by the fact that financial literacy is necessary to understand investment goals, which in turn determine the time horizon, and so on.\n\n## Common Gaps\nMany people overlook the importance of **ongoing education**, assuming that their initial financial literacy is sufficient, which can lead to a failure to adapt to changing market conditions, as seen in the case of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, where investors who failed to adjust their portfolios in response to the crisis suffered significant losses. Another common gap is the assumption of **guaranteed returns**, which can lead to excessive risk-taking, as seen in the case of the dot-com bubble, where investors assumed that technology stocks would continue to rise indefinitely, resulting in significant losses when the bubble burst.",
