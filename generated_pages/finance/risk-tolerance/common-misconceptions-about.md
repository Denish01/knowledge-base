# Common Misconceptions About Risk Tolerance

Most people believe that **risk tolerance** is a fixed trait that does not change over time, but this is far from the truth. 
## Misconceptions
- **Myth:** Risk tolerance is solely determined by an individual's personality.
- **Fact:** Risk tolerance can be influenced by factors such as income level, financial knowledge, and life experiences, as seen in the work of economist **Daniel Kahneman**, who demonstrated that people's risk tolerance can shift depending on their current financial situation (Kahneman's prospect theory).
- **Source of confusion:** This myth persists due to the oversimplification of risk tolerance in popular media, which often portrays it as an inherent trait rather than a complex interplay of factors.
- **Myth:** Investors with high risk tolerance always earn higher returns.
- **Fact:** Research by **Harry Markowitz** has shown that a well-diversified portfolio can provide higher returns for a given level of risk, regardless of the investor's risk tolerance, as evidenced by the ~8% average annual return of the S&P 500 index (S&P Dow Jones Indices).
- **Source of confusion:** This myth is fueled by the misconception that taking on more risk always leads to higher returns, which is not supported by historical data.
- **Myth:** Risk tolerance is the same as risk capacity.
- **Fact:** Risk capacity refers to an individual's ability to absorb losses, whereas risk tolerance refers to their willingness to take on risk, as distinguished by **David Blanchett** in his work on retirement planning.
- **Source of confusion:** The terms are often used interchangeably in financial media, leading to confusion among investors.
- **Myth:** Older investors are always more risk-averse.
- **Fact:** While it is true that older investors may have a lower risk tolerance on average, there is significant variation within this group, and some older investors may still have a high risk tolerance, as seen in the ~20% of investors over 65 who hold stocks in their portfolios (Investment Company Institute).
- **Source of confusion:** This myth may arise from the stereotype that older investors are more conservative, which is not necessarily supported by empirical evidence.
- **Myth:** Risk tolerance is not important for retirement planning.
- **Fact:** Risk tolerance plays a critical role in determining the optimal asset allocation for a retirement portfolio, as demonstrated by **William Sharpe** in his work on portfolio optimization.
- **Source of confusion:** Some retirement planning models oversimplify the role of risk tolerance, leading to suboptimal investment decisions.
- **Myth:** Investors can accurately assess their own risk tolerance.
- **Fact:** Research by **Meir Statman** has shown that investors often overestimate their risk tolerance, particularly during periods of market volatility, as evidenced by the ~30% of investors who sold stocks during the 2008 financial crisis (Securities and Exchange Commission).
- **Source of confusion:** This myth persists due to the lack of objective measures of risk tolerance, leading to reliance on self-reported assessments.
