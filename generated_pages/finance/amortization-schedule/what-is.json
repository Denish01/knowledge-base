For example, a $200,000 mortgage with a 30-year repayment term and an interest rate of 4% would have a monthly payment of $955.66, with the majority of the payment going towards interest in the early years of the loan. As the loan progresses, the amount of interest paid decreases and the amount of principal paid increases. This is because the interest is calculated as a percentage of the outstanding loan balance, so as the loan balance decreases, the amount of interest paid also decreases.\n\nThe amortization schedule can be used to calculate the total interest paid over the life of the loan, which can be substantial. For instance, a $200,000 mortgage with a 30-year repayment term and an interest rate of 4% would result in a total of $143,739 in interest paid over the life of the loan, bringing the total cost of the loan to $343,739 (Mortgage Bankers Association). The schedule can also be used to calculate the loan balance at any given point in time, which can be useful for determining the amount of equity in a property.\n\nAmortization schedules can also be used for other types of loans, such as car loans and student loans. For example, a $30,000 car loan with a 5-year repayment term and an interest rate of 6% would have a monthly payment of $566.14, with a total of $4,419 in interest paid over the life of the loan (Experian). The amortization schedule can be used to calculate the total cost of the loan and to determine the best repayment strategy.\n\n## Key Components\n- **Loan amount**: The initial amount borrowed, which affects the monthly payment and total interest paid. A higher loan amount results in a higher monthly payment and more interest paid over the life of the loan.\n- **Interest rate**: The percentage rate at which interest is calculated, which affects the monthly payment and total interest paid. A higher interest rate results in a higher monthly payment and more interest paid over the life of the loan.\n- **Repayment term**: The length of time over which the loan is repaid, which affects the monthly payment and total interest paid. A longer repayment term results in a lower monthly payment, but more interest paid over the life of the loan.\n- **Monthly payment**: The amount paid each month to repay the loan, which is calculated based on the loan amount, interest rate, and repayment term. A higher monthly payment results in less interest paid over the life of the loan.\n- **Total interest paid**: The total amount of interest paid over the life of the loan, which can be substantial. A higher interest rate or longer repayment term results in more interest paid over the life of the loan.\n- **Loan balance**: The outstanding amount of the loan at any given point in time, which decreases as the loan is repaid. A lower loan balance results in less interest paid each month.\n\n## Common Misconceptions\n**Myth:** Amortization schedules are only used for mortgages. **Fact:** Amortization schedules can be used for other types of loans, such as car loans and student loans, as evidenced by the use of amortization schedules by lenders such as Wells Fargo and Bank of America.\n**Myth:** The monthly payment is the same each month. **Fact:** While the monthly payment is typically the same, the amount of interest and principal paid each month changes, with more interest paid in the early years of the loan and more principal paid in the later years, as shown by the Mortgage Bankers Association.\n**Myth:** Amortization schedules are not necessary for short-term loans. **Fact:** Amortization schedules can be useful for short-term loans, such as car loans, to calculate the total interest paid and to determine the best repayment strategy, as recommended by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n**Myth:** The interest rate is the only factor that affects the monthly payment. **Fact:** The loan amount and repayment term also affect the monthly payment, as shown by the formula for calculating monthly payments, which is based on **Pitts' formula** for calculating loan payments.\n\n## In Practice\nA concrete example of an amortization schedule in practice is the financing of a $500,000 commercial property by a company such as **General Electric**, with a 20-year repayment term and an interest rate of 5%. The monthly payment would be $3,346.25, with a total of $403,595 in interest paid over the life of the loan, bringing the total cost of the loan to $903,595 (KPMG). The amortization schedule would show the amount of interest and principal paid each month, with more interest paid in the early years of the loan and more principal paid in the later years. This information can be used to determine the best repayment strategy and to calculate the total cost of the loan.",
