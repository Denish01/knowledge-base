# Types of Amortization Schedule

There are six primary categories of amortization schedules, distinguished by their calculation methods and application contexts. 
## Main Categories
- **Straight-Line Amortization** — a method where the cost of an asset is evenly distributed over its useful life, characterized by a constant annual amortization expense, as seen in **Coca-Cola's** depreciation of its beverage dispensing equipment.
- **Declining Balance Amortization** — an accelerated method where the amortization expense decreases over time, typically used for assets that lose value quickly, such as **Apple's** iPhones, which depreciate rapidly due to rapid technological advancements.
- **Units-of-Production Amortization** — a method that amortizes assets based on their usage, commonly used for assets like oil wells or machinery, as in the case of **ExxonMobil's** oil extraction equipment.
- **Interest Amortization** — a method used for amortizing debt, where the interest expense is separated from the principal repayment, as seen in **General Motors'** financing of vehicle purchases.
- **Mortgage Amortization** — a schedule that outlines the repayment of a mortgage loan, including both interest and principal components, such as **Wells Fargo's** 30-year fixed-rate mortgages.
- **Sinking Fund Amortization** — a method where a company sets aside funds to repay a debt or replace an asset, as in the case of **AT&T's** retirement of its debt obligations.

## Comparison Table
| Category | Calculation Method | Application Context | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Straight-Line | Even distribution over asset life | Long-lived assets | Coca-Cola's equipment |
| Declining Balance | Accelerated depreciation | Rapidly depreciating assets | Apple's iPhones |
| Units-of-Production | Amortization based on usage | Assets with variable usage | ExxonMobil's oil extraction equipment |
| Interest Amortization | Separation of interest and principal | Debt financing | General Motors' vehicle financing |
| Mortgage Amortization | Repayment of mortgage loan | Real estate financing | Wells Fargo's 30-year mortgages |
| Sinking Fund | Setting aside funds for debt repayment | Debt retirement | AT&T's debt obligations |

## How They Relate
The categories of amortization schedules often overlap, as companies may use a combination of methods to account for different types of assets or debt. For instance, **Straight-Line Amortization** and **Declining Balance Amortization** are both used for asset depreciation, but the choice between them depends on the asset's expected usage pattern. **Interest Amortization** and **Mortgage Amortization** are closely related, as both involve the repayment of debt, but they differ in their application to different types of debt. **Units-of-Production Amortization** and **Sinking Fund Amortization** are distinct, as the former is used for assets with variable usage, while the latter is used for debt repayment. Specific pairs, such as **Straight-Line Amortization** and **Declining Balance Amortization**, are often compared to determine the most suitable method for a particular asset or context.
