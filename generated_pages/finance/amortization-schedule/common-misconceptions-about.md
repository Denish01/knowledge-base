The most common misconception about amortization schedules is that they only apply to mortgages, when in fact they can be used for any type of loan or debt repayment plan. 
- **Myth:** Amortization schedules are only used for mortgage payments.
- **Fact:** Amortization schedules can be applied to any type of loan, such as car loans or personal loans, as seen in the loan repayment plans offered by companies like Ford Motor Credit (Ford Motor Credit annual report).

- **Fact:** Amortization schedules can account for adjustable interest rates, as demonstrated by the adjustable-rate mortgage products offered by banks like Wells Fargo (Wells Fargo mortgage products).
- **Source of confusion:** The assumption of fixed interest rates may stem from the simplicity of early amortization schedule calculations, which did not account for the complexities of modern financing options.

- **Myth:** Amortization schedules are not necessary for short-term loans.
- **Fact:** Amortization schedules can be useful for short-term loans, such as payday loans or title loans, as they help borrowers understand the total cost of the loan, including interest and fees, as noted by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau report).
