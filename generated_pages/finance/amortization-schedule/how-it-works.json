  "content": "Amortization schedule is a repayment plan that outlines the **loan amount**, **interest rate**, and **loan term**, and calculates the **monthly payment** required to pay off the loan.\n\n## The Mechanism\nThe core cause-and-effect chain of an amortization schedule is the calculation of the **monthly payment** based on the **loan amount**, **interest rate**, and **loan term**, resulting in a schedule of payments that gradually reduce the **outstanding balance**. This process involves the application of **compound interest** to the **outstanding balance**, which in turn determines the **interest portion** of each **monthly payment**.\n\n## Step-by-Step\n1. The lender calculates the **monthly payment** by dividing the **loan amount** by the **number of payments**, which is typically 360 months for a 30-year mortgage, and then adjusting for the **interest rate**, resulting in a **monthly payment** of approximately $1,073 for a $200,000 loan at 4% interest.\n2. The borrower makes the **monthly payment**, which is then split into the **interest portion** and the **principal portion**, with the **interest portion** being calculated as the **outstanding balance** multiplied by the **monthly interest rate**, resulting in an **interest portion** of $665 for the first payment.\n3. The **interest portion** is deducted from the **monthly payment**, leaving the **principal portion**, which is then subtracted from the **outstanding balance**, resulting in a reduction of the **outstanding balance** by $408 for the first payment.\n4. The lender updates the **amortization schedule** to reflect the new **outstanding balance**, which is then used to calculate the **interest portion** of the next **monthly payment**, resulting in a decrease in the **interest portion** of $2.73 for the second payment.\n5. The process is repeated for each **monthly payment**, with the **interest portion** decreasing and the **principal portion** increasing over time, resulting in the **loan amount** being paid off in full after 360 months, with a total interest paid of $143,739.\n6. The final **monthly payment** is made, and the **loan** is considered **paid in full**, with the borrower having paid a total of $343,739, including $143,739 in interest, over the 30-year **loan term**.\n\n## Key Components\n- **Loan amount**: the initial amount borrowed, which determines the **monthly payment** and the **total interest paid**.\n- **Interest rate**: the rate at which **interest** is charged on the **outstanding balance**, which affects the **monthly payment** and the **total interest paid**.\n- **Loan term**: the length of time over which the **loan** is repaid, which determines the **number of payments** and the **monthly payment**.\n- **Amortization schedule**: the table or chart that outlines the **monthly payments**, **interest portions**, and **principal portions**, and tracks the **outstanding balance** over time.\n\n## Common Questions\nWhat happens if the borrower misses a payment? If the borrower misses a payment, the **outstanding balance** will increase, resulting in a higher **interest portion** for the next payment, and potentially leading to **late fees** and **penalties**.\nHow does the **interest rate** affect the **monthly payment**? A higher **interest rate** will result in a higher **monthly payment**, as more of the payment will go towards **interest**, such as a $200,000 loan at 6% interest, which would have a **monthly payment** of $1,194.\nWhat is the difference between the **interest portion** and the **principal portion**? The **interest portion** is the amount of the **monthly payment** that goes towards paying **interest** on the **outstanding balance**, while the **principal portion** is the amount that goes towards reducing the **outstanding balance**, such as the first payment on a $200,000 loan at 4% interest, which would have an **interest portion** of $665 and a **principal portion** of $408.",
