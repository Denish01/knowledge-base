# What is What Diversification Depends On?

1. INTRODUCTION
Diversification is a strategy used to manage risk by spreading investments or activities across different areas. It is essential to understand what diversification depends on, as these dependencies are the foundation upon which a successful diversification strategy is built. Without these prerequisites, diversification may not be effective, and the potential benefits may not be realized. The dependencies of diversification are critical because they determine the feasibility and success of the strategy.

2. KEY DEPENDENCIES
The following are key dependencies that diversification relies on:
- Clear Financial Goals: Diversification requires a clear understanding of financial goals, as it helps to determine the optimal allocation of resources. Without clear financial goals, it is challenging to develop an effective diversification strategy. What happens without it is that the strategy may not align with the individual's or organization's objectives, leading to suboptimal outcomes.
- Risk Tolerance Assessment: Assessing risk tolerance is necessary for diversification, as it helps to determine the level of risk that can be taken on. Without a risk tolerance assessment, the strategy may be too aggressive or too conservative, leading to poor performance or excessive risk.
- Asset Class Knowledge: Understanding different asset classes is crucial for diversification, as it allows for the selection of a range of assets that can help to minimize risk. Without asset class knowledge, the strategy may be limited to a narrow range of assets, reducing its effectiveness.
- Regular Portfolio Rebalancing: Regular portfolio rebalancing is necessary for diversification, as it helps to maintain the optimal asset allocation. Without regular portfolio rebalancing, the strategy may become unbalanced, leading to increased risk and reduced returns.
- Access to Multiple Investment Options: Having access to multiple investment options is essential for diversification, as it allows for the selection of a range of assets that can help to minimize risk. Without access to multiple investment options, the strategy may be limited, reducing its effectiveness.

3. ORDER OF IMPORTANCE
While all the dependencies are crucial, clear financial goals and risk tolerance assessment are the most critical. These two dependencies provide the foundation for the development of an effective diversification strategy. Without clear financial goals and risk tolerance assessment, the strategy may not be tailored to the individual's or organization's needs, leading to suboptimal outcomes. The other dependencies, such as asset class knowledge, regular portfolio rebalancing, and access to multiple investment options, are also essential but build upon the foundation established by clear financial goals and risk tolerance assessment.

4. COMMON GAPS
One common gap in diversification is the assumption that a single investment or asset class can provide adequate diversification. This assumption can lead to a lack of understanding of the importance of asset class knowledge and access to multiple investment options. Another common gap is the failure to regularly rebalance the portfolio, which can lead to an unbalanced strategy and increased risk. Additionally, some individuals or organizations may overlook the importance of clear financial goals and risk tolerance assessment, leading to a strategy that is not tailored to their needs.

5. SUMMARY
In conclusion, diversification depends on several key prerequisites, including clear financial goals, risk tolerance assessment, asset class knowledge, regular portfolio rebalancing, and access to multiple investment options. These dependencies provide the foundation for a successful diversification strategy, and their absence can lead to suboptimal outcomes. By understanding these dependencies and their relationships, individuals and organizations can develop an effective diversification strategy that helps to minimize risk and achieve their financial objectives. The essential foundation for diversification is a thorough understanding of these prerequisites and their importance in establishing a well-diversified portfolio.
