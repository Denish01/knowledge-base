These misconceptions often arise from a lack of understanding of the rules and regulations governing these accounts. As a result, people may make incorrect assumptions or believe false information. It's essential to separate fact from fiction to make informed decisions about retirement savings.

  **Reality:** To contribute to a Roth IRA, you must have earned income from a job and your income must be below certain thresholds.
  **Why people believe this:** The rules for traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs differ, leading to confusion. People may assume that the rules for one type of IRA apply to all IRAs.
- **Myth:** You can withdraw money from a Roth IRA at any time without penalty.
  **Reality:** While contributions can be withdrawn at any time, earnings are subject to a five-year waiting period and a penalty for early withdrawal.
  **Why people believe this:** The distinction between contributions and earnings is often misunderstood. People may not realize that the rules for withdrawing contributions and earnings differ.

  **Reality:** Unlike traditional IRAs, Roth IRAs do not have RMDs during the account owner's lifetime.
  **Why people believe this:** The rules for traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs are often conflated. People may assume that the RMD rules for traditional IRAs apply to Roth IRAs as well.

  **Reality:** While you can have both types of accounts, the total amount you can contribute to all your IRAs in a year is limited.
  **Why people believe this:** The rules for contributing to IRAs are complex, and people may not understand the aggregate limit that applies to all IRAs.
- **Myth:** Roth IRA conversions are always subject to income tax.
  **Reality:** While it's true that converting a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA is a taxable event, the tax implications depend on the individual's tax situation.
