It is essential to understand how compound interest works to make informed choices about savings, investments, and debt.

2. MISCONCEPTION LIST:
Here are some common misconceptions about compound interest, along with the reality and the source of the confusion:
- Myth: Compound interest is only earned on the initial principal amount.
  Reality: Compound interest is earned on both the principal amount and any accrued interest.
  Why people believe this: This misconception may arise from a lack of understanding of how interest is calculated. People may think that interest is only applied to the initial amount, rather than the growing balance.
- Myth: Compound interest is the same as simple interest.
  Reality: Compound interest is different from simple interest, which is only earned on the principal amount.
