# What Affects Compound Interest

The single biggest factor affecting compound interest is **interest rate**, which increases compound interest by determining the proportion of principal that is added to the total in each compounding period, as seen in the example of a savings account with a 5% annual interest rate, where a $1,000 principal would grow to $1,276 after 5 years with annual compounding.

## Main Factors
- **Interest Rate** — affects compound interest by determining the proportion of principal that is added to the total in each compounding period, increases compound interest, and can have a significant impact, such as a 1% increase in interest rate leading to a 10% increase in compound interest over 10 years, as demonstrated by the difference between a 4% and 5% interest rate on a $10,000 principal, where the 5% interest rate would yield $16,386 after 10 years, compared to $14,824 with a 4% interest rate.
- **Compounding Frequency** — affects compound interest by determining how often interest is added to the principal, increases compound interest, and can result in a substantial difference, such as daily compounding versus annual compounding, where a $5,000 principal with a 6% annual interest rate would grow to $9,558 after 10 years with daily compounding, compared to $9,558 with annual compounding, but the daily compounding would yield $9,595 after 10 years if the interest rate were 7%, demonstrating the increased effect of higher interest rates.
- **Principal Amount** — affects compound interest by determining the base amount to which interest is added, increases compound interest, and can have a significant impact, such as a $10,000 principal versus a $5,000 principal, where the $10,000 principal would yield $16,386 after 10 years with a 5% interest rate, compared to $8,193 for the $5,000 principal.
- **Time** — affects compound interest by determining the number of compounding periods, increases compound interest, and can result in a substantial difference, such as 10 years versus 20 years, where a $5,000 principal with a 6% annual interest rate would grow to $9,558 after 10 years, compared to $21,120 after 20 years.
- **Withdrawal Rate** — affects compound interest by determining the proportion of the total that is withdrawn in each period, decreases compound interest, and can have a significant impact, such as a 2% annual withdrawal rate, where a $10,000 principal with a 5% annual interest rate would yield $12,763 after 10 years, compared to $16,386 without withdrawals.
- **Inflation Rate** — affects compound interest by determining the decrease in purchasing power of the principal and interest, decreases compound interest, and can result in a substantial difference, such as a 2% annual inflation rate, where a $5,000 principal with a 6% annual interest rate would have a real value of $7,786 after 10 years, compared to $9,558 without inflation.
- **Taxes** — affects compound interest by determining the proportion of interest that is paid to the government, decreases compound interest, and can have a significant impact, such as a 20% tax rate on interest, where a $10,000 principal with a 5% annual interest rate would yield $13,426 after 10 years, compared to $16,386 without taxes.

## How They Interact
The interaction between **interest rate** and **compounding frequency** can amplify the effect of compound interest, such as a high interest rate combined with daily compounding, which can result in a substantial increase in compound interest, as seen in the example of a $5,000 principal with a 7% annual interest rate and daily compounding, where the total after 10 years would be $10,677, compared to $9,558 with annual compounding. The interaction between **principal amount** and **time** can also have a significant impact, such as a large principal combined with a long time period, which can result in a substantial increase in compound interest, as demonstrated by the difference between a $10,000 principal and a $5,000 principal, both with a 5% annual interest rate and 20 years, where the $10,000 principal would yield $26,532, compared to $13,266 for the $5,000 principal. The interaction between **inflation rate** and **interest rate** can cancel each other out, such as a high interest rate combined with a high inflation rate, which can result in a negligible effect on compound interest, as seen in the example of a $5,000 principal with a 6% annual interest rate and a 4% annual inflation rate, where the real value after 10 years would be $7,430, compared to $7,786 without inflation.

## Controllable vs Uncontrollable
The controllable factors are **principal amount**, **withdrawal rate**, and **compounding frequency**, which can be controlled by the individual, such as by depositing a larger principal, withdrawing a smaller proportion, or choosing a higher compounding frequency. The uncontrollable factors are **interest rate**, **inflation rate**, and **taxes**, which are determined by external forces, such as the government or market conditions. For example, an individual can control the **principal amount** by depositing a larger amount, but cannot control the **interest rate**, which is set by the bank or financial institution. Similarly, an individual can control the **compounding frequency** by choosing a daily or monthly compounding option, but cannot control the **inflation rate**, which is determined by economic conditions.
