  "content": "The **principal amount** is the most critical dependency for compound interest, as it dictates the base value that interest will accrue upon. Without a principal amount, compound interest cannot function, as seen in the case of the 2008 financial crisis where many mortgage-backed securities had inadequate or non-existent principal amounts, leading to a massive devaluation of these assets. \n\n## Key Dependencies\n- **Principal amount** \u2014 required to calculate the interest, and without it, compound interest cannot accrue, as the absence of a principal amount in the aforementioned mortgage-backed securities led to a loss of over $1 trillion in value (IMF).\n- **Interest rate** \u2014 needed to determine the rate at which interest will accrue, and a zero or negative interest rate would render compound interest ineffective, as seen in Japan's experience with negative interest rates, where economic growth remained stagnant despite the policy (Bank of Japan).\n- **Time** \u2014 necessary for interest to accrue, and without it, compound interest would not be able to grow, as exemplified by the failure of the Soviet Union's economic system, which did not account for the time value of money, leading to inefficient allocation of resources (Kornai's shortage economy model).\n- **Compounding frequency** \u2014 affects how often interest is applied to the principal amount, and a low compounding frequency would reduce the effectiveness of compound interest, as seen in the case of savings accounts with low compounding frequencies, which often result in lower returns for depositors (Federal Reserve).\n- **Risk-free rate** \u2014 influences the interest rate and, by extension, the compound interest, as a high risk-free rate would increase the interest rate, and a low risk-free rate would decrease it, as demonstrated by the impact of the US Federal Reserve's monetary policy on interest rates and economic growth (Milton Friedman's monetary policy framework).\n\n## Priority Order\nThe dependencies can be ranked from most to least critical as follows:\n- **Principal amount**, as it is the foundation upon which compound interest is calculated, and without it, compound interest cannot exist.\n- **Interest rate**, as it determines the rate at which interest will accrue, and a zero or negative interest rate would render compound interest ineffective.\n- **Time**, as it is necessary for interest to accrue, and without it, compound interest would not be able to grow.\n- **Compounding frequency**, as it affects how often interest is applied to the principal amount, but its impact is less significant than the previous three dependencies.\n- **Risk-free rate**, as it influences the interest rate, but its impact is less direct than the previous four dependencies.\n\n## Common Gaps\nPeople often overlook or take for granted the **time value of money**, assuming that money today is equivalent to money in the future, which can lead to inadequate planning and a failure to account for inflation, as seen in the case of the Argentine economic crisis, where the government's failure to account for inflation led to a significant devaluation of the currency (Ricardo's comparative advantage model).",
