# How Compound Interest Works

Compound interest is a financial mechanism where **interest** accrues on both the initial principal amount and any accrued interest, resulting in exponential growth over time. The core cause-and-effect chain involves the initial principal amount, the interest rate, the compounding frequency, and the time period, ultimately producing a final amount that is greater than the initial principal.

## The Mechanism
Compound interest works by adding the interest to the principal amount at regular intervals, such that the interest in the next interval is calculated on the new principal balance. This process creates a snowball effect, where the interest earned in each interval increases exponentially, resulting in a significant increase in the final amount.

## Step-by-Step
1. The process begins with an initial principal amount, such as $1,000, and an interest rate, such as 5% per annum, which is compounded annually. The interest earned in the first year is $50, resulting in a new principal balance of $1,050.
2. In the second year, the interest rate of 5% is applied to the new principal balance of $1,050, resulting in an interest earning of $52.50, which increases the principal balance to $1,102.50. This represents a 5.25% increase in the principal balance.
3. As the years pass, the interest earned in each interval increases exponentially, such that after 10 years, the principal balance grows to $1,628.89, representing a 62.89% increase over the initial principal amount.
4. The compounding frequency also affects the final amount, such that if the interest is compounded monthly, the final amount after 10 years would be $1,647.01, representing a 64.70% increase over the initial principal amount.
5. The time period also plays a crucial role, such that if the principal amount is invested for 20 years, the final amount would be $2,653.30, representing a 165.33% increase over the initial principal amount.
6. Using the **rule of 72**, which states that to find the number of years it takes for an investment to double, one can divide 72 by the interest rate, we can calculate that an investment with an interest rate of 5% will double in approximately 14.4 years.

## Key Components
- **Principal amount**: The initial amount of money invested, which serves as the base for the interest calculation.
- **Interest rate**: The percentage rate at which interest is earned, which determines the amount of interest accrued in each interval.
- **Compounding frequency**: The frequency at which interest is added to the principal amount, such as annually or monthly, which affects the final amount.
- **Time period**: The length of time the principal amount is invested, which determines the total amount of interest earned.

## Common Questions
What happens if the interest rate changes over time? If the interest rate increases, the interest earned in each interval will also increase, resulting in a higher final amount, such as a 1% increase in the interest rate, which would result in a 10% increase in the final amount after 10 years. 
What is the effect of compounding frequency on the final amount? Compounding monthly instead of annually can result in a higher final amount, such as a 1.5% increase in the final amount after 10 years. 
Can compound interest be applied to other types of investments? Yes, compound interest can be applied to other types of investments, such as stocks and bonds, where the interest earned is reinvested to earn additional interest. 
How does compound interest affect savings accounts? Compound interest can significantly increase the balance of a savings account over time, such that a savings account with an initial principal amount of $1,000 and an interest rate of 2% per annum can grow to $1,041.12 after 1 year, representing a 4.12% increase over the initial principal amount (Bank of America).
