# Types of Compound Interest

There are four main categories of compound interest, organized by the frequency and timing of interest compounding: **Daily Compounding**, **Monthly Compounding**, **Quarterly Compounding**, and **Annual Compounding**.

## Main Categories
- **Daily Compounding** — interest is compounded daily, resulting in higher returns due to more frequent compounding, as seen in Ally Bank's online savings account, which compounds interest daily.
- **Monthly Compounding** — interest is compounded monthly, providing a balance between frequent compounding and lower administrative costs, as used by Bank of America's checking accounts, which compound interest monthly.
- **Quarterly Compounding** — interest is compounded quarterly, often used for investments with lower liquidity, such as certificates of deposit (CDs), as offered by Wells Fargo, which compounds interest quarterly on its CDs.
- **Annual Compounding** — interest is compounded annually, typically used for long-term investments with low liquidity, such as bonds, as seen in the US Treasury's 10-year bond, which compounds interest annually.

## Comparison Table
| Category | Compounding Frequency | Administrative Cost | Return on Investment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Daily Compounding | Daily | High | High, e.g., Ally Bank's 2.20% APY (Ally Bank) |
| Monthly Compounding | Monthly | Medium | Medium, e.g., Bank of America's 1.50% APY (Bank of America) |
| Quarterly Compounding | Quarterly | Low | Low, e.g., Wells Fargo's 2.00% APY (Wells Fargo) |
| Annual Compounding | Annually | Very Low | Very Low, e.g., US Treasury's 2.50% yield (US Treasury) |

## How They Relate
The categories of compound interest overlap in terms of their application to different financial products, such as savings accounts, CDs, and bonds. **Daily Compounding** and **Monthly Compounding** are often used for liquid investments, such as savings accounts and money market funds, while **Quarterly Compounding** and **Annual Compounding** are used for less liquid investments, such as CDs and bonds. Specifically, **Daily Compounding** and **Monthly Compounding** are commonly confused, as both provide relatively frequent compounding, but **Daily Compounding** results in higher returns due to more frequent compounding. In contrast, **Quarterly Compounding** and **Annual Compounding** are distinct, as **Quarterly Compounding** provides more frequent compounding than **Annual Compounding**, resulting in higher returns. Ricardo's comparative advantage model (1817) can be applied to understand the trade-offs between these categories, as investors seek to maximize returns while minimizing administrative costs.
