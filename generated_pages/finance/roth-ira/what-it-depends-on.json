  "content": "Income eligibility is the most critical dependency for a **Roth IRA**, as it determines whether an individual can contribute to this type of retirement account. \n## Key Dependencies\n- **Income Eligibility** \u2014 required to determine whether an individual can contribute to a **Roth IRA**, and the absence of eligibility can result in penalties and taxes on contributions, as seen in the case of the McGowin family, who were forced to pay a 6% excise tax on their **Roth IRA** contributions due to exceeding the income limit (IRS Tax Court).\n- **Employment Status** \u2014 necessary to determine the individual's ability to contribute to a **Roth IRA**, as self-employed individuals and those with freelance income may face different contribution limits, and the absence of stable employment can lead to reduced or no contributions, as experienced by many freelancers during the 2008 financial crisis.\n- **Tax Filing Status** \u2014 crucial in determining the individual's eligibility for **Roth IRA** contributions, as married couples filing jointly have different limits than single filers or those married filing separately, and incorrect filing status can result in penalties, such as the case of a couple who filed separately and were denied **Roth IRA** contributions due to exceeding the income limit (Tax Court).\n- **Contribution Limits** \u2014 essential to avoid excess contributions, which can result in a 6% excise tax, as seen in the case of an individual who contributed $7,000 to a **Roth IRA** in a single year, exceeding the limit, and was forced to pay the excise tax (IRS).\n- **Age Requirements** \u2014 necessary to determine the individual's eligibility to contribute to a **Roth IRA**, as those under 18 or over 70.5 may face restrictions or penalties, and the absence of age verification can result in incorrect contributions, such as the case of a minor who was allowed to contribute to a **Roth IRA** without parental consent.\n- **Custodial Accounts** \u2014 required for minors who want to contribute to a **Roth IRA**, as these accounts are managed by a parent or guardian until the minor reaches the age of majority, and the absence of a custodial account can result in penalties and taxes, as seen in the case of a minor who was forced to pay taxes on **Roth IRA** earnings due to lack of a custodial account (IRS).\n\n## Priority Order\nThe dependencies can be ranked from most to least critical as follows:\n- **Income Eligibility**, as it determines the individual's ability to contribute to a **Roth IRA** and affects the amount that can be contributed.\n- **Employment Status**, as it affects the individual's ability to contribute to a **Roth IRA** and may impact the amount that can be contributed.\n- **Tax Filing Status**, as it affects the individual's eligibility for **Roth IRA** contributions and may impact the amount that can be contributed.\n- **Contribution Limits**, as exceeding these limits can result in penalties and taxes.\n- **Age Requirements**, as failing to meet these requirements can result in penalties and taxes.\n- **Custodial Accounts**, as they are only required for minors and are not a universal dependency.\n\n## Common Gaps\nMany people overlook the **5-Year Rule**, which requires that a **Roth IRA** be open for at least five years to avoid penalties on earnings withdrawals, and assume that they can withdraw earnings at any time, resulting in penalties and taxes, such as the case of an individual who withdrew **Roth IRA** earnings after only three years and was forced to pay a 10% penalty (IRS).",
