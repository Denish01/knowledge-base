  "content": "There are several categories of **Annual Percentage Yield (APY)**, which can be organized based on the type of account or investment that earns the yield. \n\n## Main Categories\n- **High-Yield Savings APY** \u2014 a type of APY earned on high-yield savings accounts, characterized by low risk and liquidity, with a concrete example being the Ally Bank Online Savings Account, which offers a competitive APY and easy access to funds.\n- **Certificate of Deposit (CD) APY** \u2014 a type of APY earned on time deposits with fixed interest rates and maturity dates, distinguished by its fixed term and generally higher yield than traditional savings accounts, with a concrete example being the 5-year CD offered by Marcus by Goldman Sachs, which provides a fixed APY for a set period.\n- **Money Market APY** \u2014 a type of APY earned on money market accounts, characterized by low risk, liquidity, and a mix of low-risk investments, with a concrete example being the Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund, which invests in a diversified portfolio of short-term, high-quality securities.\n- **Interest-Bearing Checking APY** \u2014 a type of APY earned on interest-bearing checking accounts, distinguished by its liquidity and ability to write checks or use a debit card, with a concrete example being the Discover Cashback Debit account, which offers a competitive APY and rewards program.\n\n## Comparison Table\n| Category | Liquidity | Risk | Yield |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| High-Yield Savings APY | High | Low | 1.5% - 2.5% (Ally Bank) |\n| CD APY | Low | Low | 2.0% - 4.0% (Marcus by Goldman Sachs) |\n| Money Market APY | High | Low | 1.0% - 3.0% (Vanguard) |\n| Interest-Bearing Checking APY | High | Low | 0.1% - 2.0% (Discover) |\n\n## How They Relate\nThe categories of APY often overlap, as many accounts and investments offer a combination of features. For example, a high-yield savings account may also offer a debit card or checks, blurring the line with interest-bearing checking accounts. The **CD APY** and **Money Market APY** are commonly confused, as both offer low-risk investments with competitive yields, but they differ in their liquidity and investment strategies. The **High-Yield Savings APY** and **Interest-Bearing Checking APY** are often compared, as both offer liquid accounts with competitive yields, but they differ in their primary purpose and features. Ricardo's comparative advantage model (1817) can be applied to understand the trade-offs between these categories, as investors weigh the benefits of higher yields against the costs of reduced liquidity or increased risk. Boeing's financial reports (Boeing annual report) demonstrate the importance of understanding APY categories in managing corporate cash flows and investments.",
