  "content": "Annual percentage yield (**APY**) is a mechanism that calculates the rate of return on an investment, taking into account the effect of compounding interest, with inputs including the principal amount, interest rate, and compounding frequency, producing an output of the total amount of interest earned over a year. The APY mechanism involves a chain of cause-and-effect relationships between these inputs, resulting in a higher output value than the nominal interest rate would suggest.\n\n## The Mechanism\nThe core cause-and-effect chain of APY involves the conversion of a nominal interest rate into an effective interest rate, using the formula: APY = (1 + r/n)^(n-1), where r is the nominal interest rate and n is the number of compounding periods per year. This process produces an output of the total amount of interest earned over a year, which is then used to calculate the APY.\n\n## Step-by-Step\n1. The **principal amount** is deposited into an account, such as a certificate of deposit (CD) or savings account, with a nominal interest rate of 2%, which causes the bank to pay interest on the deposit.\n2. The interest rate is compounded **daily**, with 365 compounding periods per year, resulting in an APY of 2.07%, which is 0.07% higher than the nominal interest rate.\n3. The APY is calculated using the formula: APY = (1 + 0.02/365)^(365-1), which produces an output of 1.0207, representing the total amount of interest earned over a year.\n4. The APY is then used to calculate the **total amount** of interest earned over a year, which is $1,020.70 for a $1,000 principal amount, resulting in a $20.70 interest payment.\n5. The APY is also affected by the **compounding frequency**, with more frequent compounding resulting in a higher APY, such as 2.15% for monthly compounding, which is 0.08% higher than daily compounding.\n6. The APY is **annually** reviewed and updated to reflect changes in market interest rates, such as a 0.25% increase in the federal funds rate, which causes the APY to increase by 0.25% to 2.32%.\n\n## Key Components\n- **Principal amount**: the initial deposit, which determines the base amount of interest earned, and if removed, would result in no interest being earned.\n- **Interest rate**: the nominal rate at which interest is earned, which affects the APY, and if changed, would result in a different APY, such as a 0.5% decrease in the interest rate resulting in a 0.5% decrease in the APY.\n- **Compounding frequency**: the number of times interest is compounded per year, which affects the APY, and if changed, would result in a different APY, such as a change from daily to monthly compounding resulting in a 0.08% decrease in the APY.\n- **Time**: the length of time the principal amount is invested, which affects the total amount of interest earned, and if shortened, would result in less interest being earned, such as a 1-year CD earning less interest than a 5-year CD.\n\n## Common Questions\nWhat happens if the interest rate changes during the investment period? The APY will be adjusted to reflect the new interest rate, resulting in a different total amount of interest earned, such as a 0.25% increase in the interest rate resulting in a $2.50 increase in interest earned. \nWhat is the effect of compounding frequency on APY? More frequent compounding results in a higher APY, such as daily compounding resulting in a 0.07% higher APY than monthly compounding. \nHow does the principal amount affect the APY? The principal amount determines the base amount of interest earned, but does not affect the APY, which is a percentage rate, such as a $1,000 principal amount earning the same APY as a $10,000 principal amount. \nWhat is the difference between APY and nominal interest rate? The APY takes into account the effect of compounding interest, resulting in a higher rate than the nominal interest rate, such as an APY of 2.07% compared to a nominal interest rate of 2%.",
