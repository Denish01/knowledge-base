  "content": "## Definition\nIndex fund is a type of investment fund that aims to track the performance of a specific **stock market index**, such as the S&P 500, by holding a portfolio of stocks that replicates the index, a concept first introduced by Vanguard's John Bogle in 1976.\n\n## How It Works\nIndex funds work by pooling money from investors to purchase a representative sample of stocks or bonds that make up the underlying index, thereby allowing individuals to invest in a broad range of assets with a single investment. The **net asset value (NAV)** of an index fund is calculated by dividing the total value of the fund's assets by the number of outstanding shares, with Vanguard's Total Stock Market Index Fund holding ~3,000 stocks (Vanguard annual report). Index funds typically use a **passive management** approach, which means that the fund manager does not attempt to beat the market by actively buying and selling securities, but instead focuses on tracking the underlying index, resulting in lower **expense ratios**, such as the 0.04% expense ratio of the Schwab U.S. Broad Market ETF (Schwab annual report).\n\nThe performance of an index fund is closely tied to the performance of the underlying index, with the fund's **tracking error** measuring the degree to which the fund's returns deviate from the index's returns, such as the 0.05% tracking error of the iShares Core S&P Total U.S. Stock Market ETF (iShares annual report). Index funds can be used to invest in a wide range of asset classes, including **domestic stocks**, **international stocks**, and **bonds**, with the iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF tracking the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index (iShares annual report). By investing in an index fund, investors can gain **diversification** benefits, as the fund's portfolio is spread across a large number of securities, reducing the risk of any one security's performance affecting the overall portfolio, such as the ~500 stocks held by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPDR annual report).\n\nIndex funds can be traded on an exchange like individual stocks, allowing investors to buy and sell shares throughout the day, with the **trading volume** of the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund averaging ~1 million shares per day (Vanguard annual report). This flexibility, combined with the fund's ability to track a specific index, makes index funds a popular choice for investors seeking a low-cost, low-maintenance investment option, such as the ~$1 trillion in assets held by the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (Vanguard annual report).\n\n## Key Components\n- **Index**: the specific stock market index that the fund aims to track, such as the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average, with the S&P 500 consisting of ~500 large-cap stocks (S&P Dow Jones Indices).\n- **Portfolio**: the collection of stocks or bonds held by the fund, with the iShares Core S&P Total U.S. Stock Market ETF holding ~3,000 stocks (iShares annual report).\n- **Expense ratio**: the fee charged by the fund manager to cover administrative and operational costs, with the Schwab U.S. Broad Market ETF having an expense ratio of 0.03% (Schwab annual report).\n- **Tracking error**: the degree to which the fund's returns deviate from the index's returns, with the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund having a tracking error of 0.01% (Vanguard annual report).\n- **Diversification**: the spreading of investments across a range of asset classes to reduce risk, with the iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF holding ~8,000 bonds (iShares annual report).\n- **Trading volume**: the number of shares bought and sold on a given day, with the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust averaging ~100 million shares per day (SPDR annual report).\n\n## Common Misconceptions\n**Myth:** Index funds are only suitable for conservative investors \u2014 **Fact:** Index funds can be used by investors with a wide range of risk tolerance levels, as they offer a diversified portfolio that can be tailored to meet individual investment goals, such as the ~$10 billion in assets held by the iShares Core S&P Total U.S. Stock Market ETF (iShares annual report).\n**Myth:** Index funds are only available for domestic stocks \u2014 **Fact:** Index funds can be used to invest in a wide range of asset classes, including international stocks and bonds, such as the ~$50 billion in assets held by the iShares MSCI EAFE ETF (iShares annual report).\n**Myth:** Index funds are not actively managed \u2014 **Fact:** While index funds do not attempt to beat the market through active buying and selling, the fund manager still plays a crucial role in maintaining the fund's portfolio and tracking the underlying index, with the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund having a team of ~20 portfolio managers (Vanguard annual report).\n**Myth:** Index funds are only available through financial institutions \u2014 **Fact:** Index funds can be purchased directly from the fund manager or through a variety of online brokerages, such as Fidelity or Charles Schwab, with the ~$1 trillion in assets held by the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (Vanguard annual report).\n\n## In Practice\nThe Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund is a concrete example of an index fund in practice, with ~$1 trillion in assets and a **dividend yield** of 1.8% (Vanguard annual report). The fund tracks the CRSP US Total Market Index, which consists of ~3,000 stocks, and has an expense ratio of 0.04% (Vanguard annual report). In 2020, the fund returned ~20% (Vanguard annual report), closely tracking the performance of the underlying index. The fund's **net assets** are ~$1 trillion, with ~100 million shares outstanding (Vanguard annual report). By investing in this fund, investors can gain exposure to a broad range of domestic stocks, with the fund's portfolio consisting of ~3,000 stocks, including ~500 large-cap stocks, such as Apple and Microsoft (Vanguard annual report).",
