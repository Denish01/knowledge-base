# How Index Fund Works

Index funds work by pooling money from investors to purchase a representative sample of a particular **stock market index**, such as the S&P 500, with the goal of matching its performance. The core mechanism involves investing in a diversified portfolio of stocks, which reduces **risk** and increases potential long-term returns, as demonstrated by the **efficient market hypothesis**.

## The Mechanism
The index fund mechanism involves investing in a portfolio of stocks that replicates a specific market index, with the goal of matching its performance by holding a small portion of each stock in the index. This approach allows investors to benefit from the overall performance of the market, rather than trying to pick individual winners, as described by **Ricardo's comparative advantage model**.

## Step-by-Step
1. Investors put money into an index fund, which is then used to purchase a representative sample of stocks in the target market index, such as the S&P 500, which includes 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the US, with a total market capitalization of over $23 trillion (S&P Dow Jones Indices).
2. The index fund manager buys a small portion of each stock in the index, typically using a **capitalization-weighted** approach, where the largest companies in the index, such as Apple and Microsoft, account for a larger proportion of the fund's holdings, with Apple's market capitalization being over $2 trillion (Yahoo Finance).
3. As the market index changes, the index fund manager adjusts the portfolio by buying or selling stocks to maintain the same weighting as the index, with the goal of matching its performance, as measured by the **Sharpe ratio**, which calculates the excess return of an investment over the risk-free rate, relative to its volatility.
4. The index fund earns dividends and interest from the stocks in the portfolio, which are then distributed to investors, with the average annual dividend yield of the S&P 500 being around 2% (S&P Dow Jones Indices).
5. Investors can buy or sell shares of the index fund at the current net asset value (NAV), which is calculated by dividing the total value of the portfolio by the number of outstanding shares, with the NAV of the Vanguard 500 Index Fund being around $300 per share (Vanguard).
6. The index fund's performance is tracked and compared to the target market index, with the goal of matching its returns, as measured by the **tracking error**, which calculates the difference between the fund's returns and the index's returns, with a lower tracking error indicating better performance.

## Key Components
- **Stock market index**: the target index that the fund seeks to replicate, such as the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
- **Index fund manager**: responsible for maintaining the portfolio and making adjustments to track the index, using techniques such as **portfolio optimization**.
- **Investors**: provide the capital for the fund and receive dividends and interest from the portfolio, with the total assets under management (AUM) of index funds being over $10 trillion (Investment Company Institute).
- **Portfolio**: the collection of stocks that make up the index fund, with the average portfolio turnover rate being around 5% per year (Morningstar).

## Common Questions
What happens if the index fund manager fails to track the index? The fund's performance will deviate from the index, resulting in a higher tracking error, such as the 1.2% tracking error of the Fidelity 500 Index Fund (Fidelity).
How do index funds handle dividends and interest? The fund earns dividends and interest from the stocks in the portfolio, which are then distributed to investors, with the average annual dividend payout of the S&P 500 being around $50 per share (S&P Dow Jones Indices).
What is the difference between an index fund and an actively managed fund? An index fund seeks to replicate a market index, while an actively managed fund tries to beat the market through stock selection and portfolio management, with the average annual fee of an actively managed fund being around 1.5% (Investment Company Institute).
Can index funds be used for retirement savings? Yes, index funds are often used in retirement accounts, such as 401(k) plans, due to their low costs and long-term growth potential, with the average annual return of the S&P 500 being around 10% over the past 30 years (S&P Dow Jones Indices).
