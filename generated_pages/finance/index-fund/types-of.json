  "content": "There are four main categories of index funds, organized by their underlying investment strategies: **Equity Index Funds**, **Bond Index Funds**, **Commodity Index Funds**, and **Hybrid Index Funds**.\n\n## Main Categories\n- **Equity Index Funds** \u2014 track a specific stock market index, such as the S&P 500, and hold a portfolio of stocks that replicates the index's composition, like Vanguard 500 Index Fund.\n- **Bond Index Funds** \u2014 invest in a diversified portfolio of bonds that mirrors a particular bond market index, such as the Bloomberg Barclays US Aggregate Bond Index, like iShares Core US Aggregate Bond ETF.\n- **Commodity Index Funds** \u2014 track the performance of a specific commodity index, such as the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index, and hold a portfolio of commodity futures contracts or other derivative instruments, like Invesco DB Commodity Index Tracking Fund.\n- **Hybrid Index Funds** \u2014 combine different asset classes, such as stocks and bonds, to create a diversified portfolio that tracks a specific hybrid index, like Vanguard Balanced Index Fund, which tracks the CRSP US Total Market Index for stocks and the Bloomberg Barclays US Aggregate Float Adjusted Index for bonds.\n\n## Comparison Table\n| Category | Cost | Diversification | Risk |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Equity Index Funds** | Low, e.g., 0.04% for Vanguard 500 Index Fund (Vanguard) | High, tracking a broad market index like S&P 500 | High, subject to stock market volatility |\n| **Bond Index Funds** | Low, e.g., 0.04% for iShares Core US Aggregate Bond ETF (BlackRock) | Medium, tracking a specific bond market index | Medium, subject to interest rate and credit risk |\n| **Commodity Index Funds** | High, e.g., 0.85% for Invesco DB Commodity Index Tracking Fund (Invesco) | Low, tracking a specific commodity index | High, subject to commodity price volatility |\n| **Hybrid Index Funds** | Medium, e.g., 0.22% for Vanguard Balanced Index Fund (Vanguard) | High, tracking a diversified hybrid index | Medium, subject to both stock and bond market risks |\n\n## How They Relate\nThe categories overlap in that **Equity Index Funds** and **Bond Index Funds** are often combined to create **Hybrid Index Funds**, which aim to balance risk and return by allocating assets across different asset classes. **Commodity Index Funds** are often used as a hedge against inflation or to diversify a portfolio beyond traditional stocks and bonds. Specifically, **Equity Index Funds** and **Commodity Index Funds** are commonly confused due to their high-risk profiles, but they track different underlying markets and have distinct investment characteristics. In contrast, **Bond Index Funds** and **Hybrid Index Funds** are often compared due to their focus on income generation, but they differ in their asset allocation and risk profiles.",
