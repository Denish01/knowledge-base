# What Index Fund Depends On

The **liquidity of the underlying market** is the most critical dependency for an index fund, as without it, the fund cannot efficiently buy or sell securities to track the underlying index, as seen in the case of the 2008 financial crisis when many index funds experienced significant liquidity problems due to the freeze in the credit market.

## Key Dependencies
- **Diversification** — a lack of diversification can lead to significant losses if one sector or stock experiences a downturn, as seen in the case of the dot-com bubble when many index funds heavily invested in tech stocks suffered large losses.
- **Low tracking error** — a high tracking error can result in the fund deviating significantly from the underlying index, leading to poor performance, as seen in the case of the Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets ETF, which experienced a tracking error of 2.5% in 2011 due to a combination of factors including fees and trading costs.
- **Robust risk management** — inadequate risk management can lead to significant losses during times of market stress, as seen in the case of the 2008 financial crisis when many index funds experienced significant losses due to their exposure to subprime mortgage-backed securities.
- **Accurate pricing** — inaccurate pricing can lead to misvaluation of the fund's assets, resulting in incorrect net asset values and potential losses for investors, as seen in the case of the NAV errors experienced by the iShares S&P 500 ETF in 2010.
- **Regulatory compliance** — non-compliance with regulatory requirements can result in significant fines and reputational damage, as seen in the case of the SEC's $8 million fine against BlackRock in 2015 for failing to disclose a conflict of interest.

## Priority Order
The dependencies can be ranked in the following order from most to least critical:
- **Liquidity of the underlying market**, as it is essential for the fund to be able to buy and sell securities efficiently
- **Diversification**, as it helps to reduce the risk of significant losses due to sector or stock-specific downturns
- **Robust risk management**, as it is critical for protecting the fund's assets during times of market stress
- **Low tracking error**, as it is important for ensuring that the fund's performance closely tracks the underlying index
- **Accurate pricing**, as it is necessary for ensuring that the fund's assets are correctly valued
- **Regulatory compliance**, as it is essential for maintaining the fund's reputation and avoiding regulatory penalties, but is slightly less critical than the other dependencies in terms of direct impact on the fund's performance.

## Common Gaps
Many people overlook the importance of **liquidity** when investing in index funds, assuming that the fund will always be able to buy and sell securities efficiently, but this assumption can lead to significant problems during times of market stress, as seen in the case of the 2008 financial crisis. Others take for granted the **robustness of the fund's risk management systems**, assuming that the fund is adequately protected against potential losses, but this assumption can lead to significant losses if the risk management systems are inadequate, as seen in the case of the 2008 financial crisis.
