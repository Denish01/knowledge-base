# What is Types Of Credit Score?

## INTRODUCTION
The classification of credit scores is a vital aspect of personal finance, as it helps individuals understand their creditworthiness and make informed decisions about borrowing and lending. Credit scores are numerical representations of an individual's credit history, and there are several types of credit scores that serve different purposes. Understanding the various types of credit scores is essential for managing one's financial health, as it enables individuals to identify areas for improvement and take corrective action. The classification of credit scores matters because it provides a framework for evaluating credit risk, facilitating lending decisions, and promoting financial inclusion.

## MAIN CATEGORIES
The following are the primary types of credit scores:
1. **FICO Credit Score**
   - Definition: A FICO credit score is a widely used credit score developed by Fair Isaac Corporation, which assesses an individual's creditworthiness based on their credit history. It is used by lenders to determine the likelihood of repayment.
   - Key characteristics: FICO credit scores range from 300 to 850, with higher scores indicating better credit.
   - Example: An individual with a FICO credit score of 750 may qualify for a lower interest rate on a mortgage.
2. **VantageScore**
   - Definition: VantageScore is a credit scoring model developed by the three major credit reporting agencies, which evaluates an individual's credit history and provides a credit score. It is designed to be more inclusive and provide a more comprehensive picture of an individual's creditworthiness.
   - Key characteristics: VantageScore ranges from 501 to 990, with higher scores indicating better credit.
   - Example: An individual with a VantageScore of 800 may be considered a low-risk borrower.
3. **Credit Bureau Score**
   - Definition: A credit bureau score is a credit score provided by a credit reporting agency, such as Equifax, Experian, or TransUnion. It is based on the information in an individual's credit report and is used to evaluate their creditworthiness.
   - Key characteristics: Credit bureau scores may vary depending on the agency and the specific scoring model used.
   - Example: An individual with a credit bureau score of 700 may be eligible for a credit card with a lower interest rate.
4. **Alternative Credit Score**
   - Definition: An alternative credit score is a non-traditional credit score that uses non-credit data, such as rental payments or utility bills, to evaluate an individual's creditworthiness. It is designed to provide a more comprehensive picture of an individual's financial responsibility.
   - Key characteristics: Alternative credit scores may use different data sources and scoring models than traditional credit scores.
   - Example: An individual with a thin credit file may use an alternative credit score to demonstrate their creditworthiness to a lender.
5. **Industry-Specific Credit Score**
   - Definition: An industry-specific credit score is a credit score developed for a specific industry or sector, such as mortgage or auto lending. It is designed to evaluate an individual's creditworthiness for a particular type of loan or credit product.
   - Key characteristics: Industry-specific credit scores may use different data sources and scoring models than traditional credit scores.
   - Example: An individual with a high industry-specific credit score for mortgage lending may qualify for a lower interest rate on a home loan.

Understanding the relationships between these credit scores can help individuals navigate the complex world of credit and make informed decisions about their financial health.
