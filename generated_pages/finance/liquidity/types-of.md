# Types of Liquidity

There are four primary categories of liquidity, organized by the speed and ease of converting assets into cash. 

## Main Categories
- **Market Liquidity** — refers to the ability to buy or sell a security quickly and at a stable price, with the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) being a prime example of a market with high market liquidity due to its large trading volume and tight bid-ask spreads.
- **Funding Liquidity** — describes the ability of a company or individual to meet their short-term financial obligations, as seen in the case of Goldman Sachs, which has a strong funding liquidity position due to its diverse funding sources and robust cash reserves.
- **Asset Liquidity** — concerns the ease with which an asset can be converted into cash without significantly affecting its market price, with **Real Estate** being a relatively illiquid asset, as evidenced by the lengthy process and high transaction costs associated with buying or selling properties like the Empire State Building.
- **Informational Liquidity** — relates to the availability and transparency of information about a security or asset, which is exemplified by the detailed financial disclosures required of publicly traded companies like Apple, allowing investors to make informed decisions.

## Comparison Table
| Category | Cost | Scale | Speed | Risk |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Market Liquidity | Low | Large | Fast | Low |
| Funding Liquidity | Medium | Medium | Medium | Medium |
| Asset Liquidity | High | Small | Slow | High |
| Informational Liquidity | Low | Large | Fast | Low |

## How They Relate
The categories of liquidity are interconnected, with **Market Liquidity** and **Funding Liquidity** often influencing each other, as a company's ability to meet its financial obligations (funding liquidity) can impact its stock's trading volume and price stability (market liquidity), as seen in the case of Lehman Brothers, where a loss of funding liquidity contributed to a decline in market liquidity. 
- Market liquidity can also impact **Asset Liquidity**, as the ease of buying or selling a security can affect the overall liquidity of the underlying assets, such as the impact of **NYSE** market liquidity on the liquidity of **General Electric** stocks.
- Informational liquidity can feed into market and funding liquidity, as transparent and readily available information can increase investor confidence and participation, thereby enhancing market liquidity, as demonstrated by the effect of **SEC** disclosures on **Microsoft**'s market liquidity.
Specific pairs of categories are commonly confused, such as market and funding liquidity, which are distinct but interconnected concepts, as illustrated by the difference between **JPMorgan Chase**'s market liquidity in its securities and its funding liquidity in meeting its short-term obligations.
