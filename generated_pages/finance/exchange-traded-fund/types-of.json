  "content": "There are six main categories of Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), organized by their underlying assets and investment strategies. \n## Main Categories\n- **Index ETFs** \u2014 track a specific stock or bond index, such as the S&P 500, and are designed to provide broad diversification and market exposure, with a concrete example being the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust.\n- **Sector ETFs** \u2014 focus on a specific industry or sector, such as technology or healthcare, and allow investors to target specific areas of the market, with a concrete example being the VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF.\n- **Commodity ETFs** \u2014 invest in physical commodities, such as gold or oil, or commodity futures contracts, and provide a way for investors to gain exposure to commodity markets, with a concrete example being the SPDR Gold Shares ETF.\n- **Bond ETFs** \u2014 invest in a portfolio of bonds, such as government or corporate bonds, and offer a way for investors to gain fixed income exposure, with a concrete example being the iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF.\n- **Actively Managed ETFs** \u2014 employ an active investment strategy, where the fund manager actively selects securities and makes investment decisions, and are designed to outperform a benchmark index, with a concrete example being the Fidelity Active Equity ETF.\n- **Leveraged and Inverse ETFs** \u2014 use derivatives and other financial instruments to provide magnified exposure to an underlying index or asset, and are designed for short-term trading and speculation, with a concrete example being the ProShares UltraPro S&P 500 ETF.\n\n## Comparison Table\n| Category | Cost | Scale | Speed |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Index ETFs | Low (0.05% average expense ratio) | Large ($10 billion+ in assets) | Fast (intraday trading available) |\n| Sector ETFs | Moderate (0.50% average expense ratio) | Medium ($100 million to $1 billion in assets) | Medium (intraday trading available, but less liquid than index ETFs) |\n| Commodity ETFs | High (1.00% average expense ratio) | Small ($10 million to $100 million in assets) | Slow (trading may be limited due to commodity market constraints) |\n| Bond ETFs | Low (0.20% average expense ratio) | Large ($1 billion+ in assets) | Medium (intraday trading available, but less liquid than stock ETFs) |\n| Actively Managed ETFs | High (1.50% average expense ratio) | Small ($10 million to $100 million in assets) | Slow (trading may be limited due to active management) |\n| Leveraged and Inverse ETFs | Very High (2.00% average expense ratio) | Small ($10 million to $100 million in assets) | Fast (intraday trading available, but high risk) |\n\n## How They Relate\nThe categories often overlap, with **Index ETFs** and **Sector ETFs** sharing similarities in terms of their passive investment approach, but differing in their scope and focus. **Commodity ETFs** and **Bond ETFs** can be used together to create a diversified portfolio, with commodities providing inflation protection and bonds offering fixed income. **Actively Managed ETFs** and **Leveraged and Inverse ETFs** are often used by more sophisticated investors, who are seeking to outperform the market or speculate on short-term market movements. However, these categories are commonly confused with each other, with investors mistakenly assuming that **Actively Managed ETFs** are similar to **Leveraged and Inverse ETFs**, when in fact they have distinct investment objectives and risk profiles. Specifically, the **Fidelity Active Equity ETF** and the **ProShares UltraPro S&P 500 ETF** are two examples of ETFs that are often confused with each other, but have different investment strategies and risk levels.",
