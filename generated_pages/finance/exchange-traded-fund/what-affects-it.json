  "content": "Interest rates are the single biggest factor affecting exchange traded funds, as they **decrease** the value of bond-heavy ETFs by 10-15% when they rise, such as the iShares Core US Aggregate Bond ETF, which lost 12% of its value in 2018 when interest rates increased (Federal Reserve).\n\n## Main Factors\n- **Economic indicators** \u2014 such as GDP growth rate, **increase** the value of ETFs focused on specific sectors, like the VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF, which rose 35% in 2020 when the US GDP growth rate was 2.3% (Bureau of Economic Analysis), with the magnitude of the increase depending on the sector's sensitivity to economic growth.\n- **Commodity prices** \u2014 **increase** the value of ETFs tracking commodity indices, such as the SPDR Gold Shares ETF, which gained 25% in 2019 when gold prices rose 15% (World Gold Council), with the magnitude of the increase depending on the specific commodity and the ETF's investment strategy.\n- **Sector rotation** \u2014 **varies** the value of ETFs focused on specific sectors, such as the Vanguard Information Technology ETF, which rose 45% in 2020 when investors rotated into tech stocks, while the Vanguard Financials ETF fell 15% (Vanguard), with the magnitude of the change depending on the sector's popularity and the ETF's holdings.\n- **Inflation expectations** \u2014 **decrease** the value of bond-heavy ETFs, such as the iShares TIPS Bond ETF, which lost 5% of its value in 2020 when inflation expectations rose (Bureau of Labor Statistics), with the magnitude of the decrease depending on the ETF's duration and the level of inflation expectations.\n- **Regulatory changes** \u2014 **decrease** the value of ETFs affected by new regulations, such as the Invesco Solar ETF, which fell 20% in 2018 when the US imposed tariffs on solar panels (US Trade Representative), with the magnitude of the decrease depending on the specific regulation and the ETF's holdings.\n- **Investor sentiment** \u2014 **varies** the value of ETFs, such as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, which rose 25% in 2020 when investor sentiment improved, while the ProShares Short S&P 500 ETF fell 30% (Investor's Business Daily), with the magnitude of the change depending on the level of investor optimism or pessimism.\n\n## How They Interact\nThe interaction between **interest rates** and **inflation expectations** can amplify the effect on bond-heavy ETFs, as higher interest rates and inflation expectations can **decrease** the value of these ETFs by 15-20%, such as the iShares Core US Aggregate Bond ETF, which lost 18% of its value in 2018 when interest rates and inflation expectations rose (Federal Reserve). The interaction between **sector rotation** and **economic indicators** can also amplify the effect on sector-specific ETFs, as a strong economy can **increase** the value of these ETFs by 30-40%, such as the VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF, which rose 40% in 2020 when the US GDP growth rate was 2.3% (Bureau of Economic Analysis). The interaction between **commodity prices** and **regulatory changes** can cancel each other out, as higher commodity prices can **increase** the value of commodity-tracking ETFs, while new regulations can **decrease** the value of these ETFs, such as the SPDR Gold Shares ETF, which gained 10% in 2019 when gold prices rose, but fell 5% when the US imposed tariffs on gold (World Gold Council).\n\n## Controllable vs Uncontrollable\n- Controllable factors:\n  - **Regulatory changes** \u2014 controlled by government agencies, such as the US Securities and Exchange Commission, which can impose new regulations on ETFs, affecting their value.\n  - **Investor sentiment** \u2014 controlled by investors, who can choose to buy or sell ETFs based on their sentiment, affecting the ETFs' value.\n- Uncontrollable factors:\n  - **Economic indicators** \u2014 affected by macroeconomic trends, such as GDP growth rate and inflation rate, which are outside the control of individual investors or government agencies.\n  - **Commodity prices** \u2014 affected by global supply and demand, as well as geopolitical events, which are outside the control of individual investors or government agencies.\n  - **Interest rates** \u2014 set by central banks, such as the Federal Reserve, which can affect the value of bond-heavy ETFs, but are outside the control of individual investors.",
