  "content": "Exchange traded funds (**ETFs**) operate through a mechanism where authorized participants (**APs**) buy or sell a basket of securities to create or redeem **ETF** shares, which are then traded on an exchange. This process involves the continuous creation and redemption of **ETF** shares, which maintains a tight correlation between the **ETF**'s net asset value (**NAV**) and its market price.\n\n## The Mechanism\nThe core cause-and-effect chain of **ETFs** involves the interaction between **APs**, the **ETF** sponsor, and the exchange, resulting in the creation or redemption of **ETF** shares. The process begins with the **AP** buying a basket of securities, which is then used to create new **ETF** shares, and ends with the **ETF** shares being traded on an exchange, with the **NAV** of the **ETF** being calculated and published daily.\n\n## Step-by-Step\n1. The **AP** buys a basket of securities, known as the creation basket, which typically consists of 20-50 securities, with a total value of around $1 million (Vanguard), and delivers it to the **ETF** sponsor.\n2. The **ETF** sponsor then uses the creation basket to create new **ETF** shares, which are typically traded in increments of 50,000 shares, known as a creation unit, with a value of around $2.5 million (iShares).\n3. The **ETF** shares are then listed on an exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange (**NYSE**), where they can be bought and sold by investors, with the **ETF**'s market price being determined by supply and demand, and the **NAV** being calculated and published daily, typically with a tracking error of around 0.1% (BlackRock).\n4. When an **ETF** share is sold, the **AP** buys it back and redeems it for the underlying securities, which are then sold on the market, with the proceeds being used to buy back the **ETF** shares, maintaining a tight correlation between the **ETF**'s **NAV** and its market price, and reducing the tracking error to around 0.05% (State Street).\n5. The **ETF** sponsor also earns a management fee, typically around 0.2-1.0% of the **ETF**'s assets under management (**AUM**), which is used to cover the costs of managing the **ETF**, including the costs of buying and selling securities, and distributing dividends to shareholders, with the average **AUM** of an **ETF** being around $500 million (Investment Company Institute).\n6. The **ETF**'s **NAV** is calculated daily, typically using a pricing model, such as the **Black-Scholes** model, and is published on the **ETF** sponsor's website, with the **NAV** being used to determine the **ETF**'s market price, and to calculate the **ETF**'s performance, including its return on investment (**ROI**), which is typically around 5-10% per annum (Morningstar).\n\n## Key Components\n- **Authorized Participants** (**APs**): buy and sell the creation basket, creating or redeeming **ETF** shares, and maintaining a tight correlation between the **ETF**'s **NAV** and its market price.\n- **ETF Sponsor**: manages the **ETF**, including buying and selling securities, calculating the **NAV**, and distributing dividends to shareholders.\n- **Exchange**: lists the **ETF** shares, providing a platform for investors to buy and sell the **ETF**, and maintaining the integrity of the market.\n- **Creation Basket**: a basket of securities used to create or redeem **ETF** shares, typically consisting of 20-50 securities, with a total value of around $1 million (Vanguard).\n- **NAV**: the net asset value of the **ETF**, calculated daily, and used to determine the **ETF**'s market price, and to calculate the **ETF**'s performance.\n\n## Common Questions\nWhat happens if the **AP** fails to deliver the creation basket? The **ETF** sponsor will typically have a backup **AP** in place, or will use a different **AP** to create the **ETF** shares, ensuring that the **ETF**'s **NAV** remains correlated with its market price.\nWhat is the minimum number of **ETF** shares that can be created or redeemed? Typically, the minimum creation unit size is around 50,000 shares, with a value of around $2.5 million (iShares).\nHow often is the **ETF**'s **NAV** calculated and published? The **NAV** is typically calculated and published daily, using a pricing model, such as the **Black-Scholes** model, and is used to determine the **ETF**'s market price, and to calculate the **ETF**'s performance.\nWhat is the average tracking error of an **ETF**? The average tracking error of an **ETF** is around 0.1% (BlackRock), although this can vary depending on the **ETF** and its underlying securities.",
