  "content": "Most investors believe that **exchange-traded funds (ETFs)** are only used for speculative purposes and are highly risky investments. \n## Misconceptions\n- **Myth:** ETFs are only used for speculative purposes and are highly risky investments.\n- **Fact:** ETFs can be used for long-term investing and can be less risky than individual stocks, as they provide diversification benefits, with the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI) holding over 3,000 stocks (Vanguard).\n- **Source of confusion:** This myth persists due to the media narrative surrounding the use of ETFs by day traders and hedge funds, which often focus on short-term gains.\n\n- **Myth:** All ETFs are actively managed and have high fees.\n- **Fact:** Many ETFs are passively managed and have lower fees than actively managed mutual funds, with the iShares Core S&P Total U.S. Stock Market ETF (ITOT) having an expense ratio of 0.03% (iShares).\n- **Source of confusion:** This myth may have originated from the fact that some of the first ETFs were actively managed, and this misconception has been perpetuated by the financial media.\n\n- **Myth:** ETFs are only available for stocks and are not available for other asset classes.\n- **Fact:** ETFs are available for a wide range of asset classes, including bonds, commodities, and currencies, with the iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF (AGG) tracking the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index (Bloomberg).\n- **Source of confusion:** This myth may have arisen from the fact that the first ETFs were primarily focused on stocks, and this limited availability has been mistakenly assumed to still be the case.\n\n- **Myth:** ETFs are more tax-efficient than mutual funds.\n- **Fact:** While ETFs can be more tax-efficient than mutual funds in some cases, this is not always the case, and the tax efficiency of an ETF depends on the underlying investments and the investor's tax situation, with a study by Morningstar finding that the tax efficiency of ETFs and mutual funds can vary significantly (Morningstar).\n- **Source of confusion:** This myth may have originated from the fact that ETFs are often compared to mutual funds in terms of tax efficiency, and the differences in tax treatment between the two investment vehicles have been oversimplified.\n\n- **Myth:** ETFs are only available for large investors and are not accessible to individual investors.\n- **Fact:** ETFs are available to individual investors and can be purchased through most brokerage accounts, with Fidelity offering a wide range of ETFs to its customers (Fidelity).\n- **Source of confusion:** This myth may have arisen from the fact that some ETFs have high minimum investment requirements, and this has been mistakenly assumed to apply to all ETFs.\n\n- **Myth:** ETFs are highly correlated with the underlying index and do not provide any benefits over investing directly in the index.\n- **Fact:** While ETFs are designed to track an underlying index, they can provide benefits such as liquidity, flexibility, and diversification, with the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) providing investors with the ability to buy and sell the S&P 500 index throughout the trading day (State Street).\n- **Source of confusion:** This myth may have originated from the fact that ETFs are often compared to index funds, and the differences between the two investment vehicles have been oversimplified.\n\n## Quick Reference\n- **Myth: ETFs are only used for speculative purposes** \u2192 **Fact:** ETFs can be used for long-term investing and provide
