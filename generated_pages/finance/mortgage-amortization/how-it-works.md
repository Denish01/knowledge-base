# How Mortgage Amortization Works

Mortgage amortization is a financial mechanism that reduces the outstanding balance of a loan through regular payments of **principal** and **interest**, with the goal of paying off the loan in full by the end of the **amortization period**.

## The Mechanism
The core cause-and-effect chain in mortgage amortization involves the borrower making monthly payments, which are applied to both the interest accrued and the principal balance, resulting in a decrease in the outstanding loan balance over time. The **amortization schedule** dictates the allocation of each payment between interest and principal, with the proportion of interest decreasing and principal increasing as the loan progresses.

## Step-by-Step
1. The borrower receives the loan amount and the lender calculates the monthly payment based on the **loan amount**, **interest rate**, and **amortization period**, such as a 30-year mortgage with a 4% interest rate and a loan amount of $200,000, resulting in a monthly payment of $955.
2. The borrower makes the first monthly payment, which is applied to the interest accrued during the first month, approximately $667, and the remaining $288 is applied to the principal balance, reducing the outstanding loan balance to $199,712.
3. As the borrower continues to make monthly payments, the interest accrued decreases, and the proportion of the payment applied to the principal balance increases, such as after 5 years, when the monthly payment is still $955, but $543 is applied to the principal and $412 is applied to interest.
4. The lender uses an **amortization table** to track the loan balance, interest paid, and principal paid over the life of the loan, ensuring that the borrower pays a total of $143,739 in interest over the 30-year amortization period.
5. The borrower's monthly payment remains constant, but the allocation between interest and principal changes, with the final payment applying the entire $955 to the principal balance, paying off the loan in full.
6. The lender updates the loan balance and **loan-to-value ratio** after each payment, ensuring that the borrower's equity in the property increases as the loan balance decreases, such as after 10 years, when the loan balance is $164,921 and the borrower's equity is $35,079.

## Key Components
- **Interest rate**: determines the amount of interest accrued each month, with higher rates resulting in more interest paid over the life of the loan.
- **Amortization period**: dictates the number of payments required to pay off the loan in full, with longer periods resulting in lower monthly payments but more interest paid overall.
- **Loan amount**: determines the total amount borrowed and the monthly payment, with larger loans resulting in higher monthly payments.
- **Amortization schedule**: outlines the allocation of each payment between interest and principal, ensuring that the loan is paid off in full by the end of the amortization period.

## Common Questions
What happens if the borrower makes extra payments? 
The borrower can make extra payments to reduce the principal balance, such as an additional $500 per month, which can save approximately $23,000 in interest over the life of the loan. 
What is the effect of a change in interest rate on the amortization schedule? 
A decrease in interest rate, such as from 4% to 3.5%, can result in a lower monthly payment, approximately $898, and a reduction in the total interest paid over the life of the loan, approximately $123,911. 
How does the loan-to-value ratio change over the life of the loan? 
The loan-to-value ratio decreases as the borrower makes payments and the loan balance decreases, such as from 80% to 60% after 10 years, indicating an increase in the borrower's equity in the property. 
What is the impact of a longer amortization period on the total interest paid? 
A longer amortization period, such as 40 years, results in lower monthly payments, approximately $843, but more interest paid over the life of the loan, approximately $184,419.
