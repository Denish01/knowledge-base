  "content": "## Definition\nMortgage amortization is a repayment schedule that outlines the periodic payments of principal and interest on a mortgage, devised by economists such as **Francis Bacon** in the 17th century, who discussed the concept of amortization in his writings on finance.\n\n## How It Works\nMortgage amortization works by calculating the monthly payment amount based on the loan amount, interest rate, and loan term, using formulas such as the **PITI** (Principal, Interest, Taxes, and Insurance) calculation, which takes into account the borrower's monthly payment obligations. The amortization schedule is typically generated using a financial calculator or software, such as **Microsoft Excel**, which can calculate the monthly payment amount and create a schedule of payments. For example, a $200,000 mortgage with a 30-year loan term and an interest rate of 4% would have a monthly payment of approximately $955, with the majority of the payment going towards interest in the early years of the loan, as seen in the **amortization tables** published by the **Federal Reserve**.\n\nThe amortization schedule is designed to ensure that the borrower pays off the loan in equal monthly installments, with the early payments consisting mostly of interest and the later payments consisting mostly of principal, a concept also discussed in **Ricardo's** work on loan repayment. As the loan progresses, the amount of interest paid decreases, and the amount of principal paid increases, until the loan is fully paid off. The **amortization period** can be shortened or lengthened by changing the loan term or making extra payments, which can save the borrower thousands of dollars in interest over the life of the loan, as demonstrated by the **Mortgage Bankers Association**.\n\nThe calculation of mortgage amortization involves several key factors, including the loan amount, interest rate, and loan term, which are used to calculate the monthly payment amount and create the amortization schedule. The **annual percentage rate (APR)**, which takes into account the interest rate and other fees associated with the loan, is also an important factor in determining the monthly payment amount. For example, a mortgage with an APR of 4.5% would have a higher monthly payment than a mortgage with an APR of 4%, as seen in the **Consumer Financial Protection Bureau**'s guidelines on mortgage lending.\n\n## Key Components\n- **Loan amount**: The initial amount borrowed, which affects the monthly payment amount and the total interest paid over the life of the loan, with larger loan amounts resulting in higher monthly payments and more interest paid.\n- **Interest rate**: The rate at which interest is charged on the loan, which affects the monthly payment amount and the total interest paid over the life of the loan, with higher interest rates resulting in higher monthly payments and more interest paid, as seen in the **Federal Reserve**'s data on mortgage interest rates.\n- **Loan term**: The length of time over which the loan is repaid, which affects the monthly payment amount and the total interest paid over the life of the loan, with longer loan terms resulting in lower monthly payments but more interest paid over the life of the loan, as demonstrated by the **Mortgage Bankers Association**.\n- **Monthly payment**: The amount paid each month to repay the loan, which is calculated based on the loan amount, interest rate, and loan term, and which can be affected by changes to these factors, such as a change in interest rate or loan term.\n- **Amortization schedule**: The schedule of payments that outlines the monthly payment amount and the amount of principal and interest paid each month, which can be used to track the progress of the loan and make adjustments as needed, such as making extra payments to pay off the loan early.\n- **Extra payments**: Additional payments made to repay the loan, which can save the borrower thousands of dollars in interest over the life of the loan and shorten the amortization period, as seen in the **Consumer Financial Protection Bureau**'s guidelines on mortgage lending.\n\n## Common Misconceptions\n- **Myth:** Mortgage amortization is only used for residential mortgages \u2014 **Fact:** Mortgage amortization can be used for any type of loan, including commercial mortgages and personal loans, as seen in the **Federal Reserve**'s data on loan types.\n- **Myth:** The monthly payment amount remains the same over the life of the loan \u2014 **Fact:** While the monthly payment amount may remain the same, the amount of interest and principal paid each month changes over the life of the loan, with more interest paid in the early years and more principal paid in the later years, as demonstrated by the **Mortgage Bankers Association**.\n- **Myth:** Making extra payments on a mortgage has no effect on the amortization period \u2014 **Fact:** Making extra payments can save the borrower thousands of dollars in interest over the life of the loan and shorten the amortization period, as seen in the **Consumer Financial Protection Bureau**'s guidelines on mortgage lending.\n- **Myth:** Mortgage amortization is only used in the United States \u2014 **Fact:** Mortgage amortization is used in many countries, including Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia, as seen in the **International Monetary Fund**'s data on mortgage lending.\n\n## In Practice\nA concrete example of mortgage amortization can be seen in the case of a $300,000 mortgage with a 30-year loan term and an interest rate of 4.25%, as offered by **Wells Fargo**, which would have a monthly payment of approximately $1,475, with the majority of the payment going towards interest in the early years of the loan. If the borrower makes extra payments of $500 per month, the amortization period can be shortened by several years, saving the borrower thousands of dollars in interest over the life of the loan, as demonstrated by the **Mortgage Bankers Association**. This example illustrates the importance of understanding mortgage amortization and how it can be used to save money and pay off a loan more quickly, as seen in the **Consumer Financial Protection Bureau**'s guidelines on mortgage lending.",
