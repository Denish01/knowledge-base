# Common Misconceptions About Mortgage Amortization

Mortgage amortization is often misunderstood as a simple interest calculation, where borrowers believe they are paying the same amount of interest every month, which is not the case.

## Misconceptions
- **Myth:** Borrowers think that the majority of their monthly mortgage payment goes towards paying off the principal amount.
- **Fact:** In reality, a larger portion of the early mortgage payments goes towards paying off the interest, as seen in the amortization schedule, where the interest paid in the first year can be as high as 80% of the total annual payments (Mortgage Bankers Association).
- **Source of confusion:** This myth persists due to the lack of understanding of how amortization schedules work, often oversimplified in popular media narratives.

- **Myth:** Some borrowers believe that making extra payments towards the principal will not significantly impact the overall interest paid.
- **Fact:** Extra payments can significantly reduce the total interest paid over the life of the loan, as demonstrated by the example of a $200,000 mortgage at 4% interest, where an extra $100 monthly payment can save over $10,000 in interest (Freddie Mac).
- **Source of confusion:** The myth stems from the complexity of calculating the impact of extra payments on the amortization schedule, which can be daunting for those without a financial background.

- **Myth:** Many people think that the 30-year mortgage is the most common and best option for all borrowers.
- **Fact:** While the 30-year mortgage is popular, other options like the 15-year mortgage can be more beneficial for some borrowers, as it offers a lower total interest paid over the life of the loan, with a total interest savings of over $40,000 on a $200,000 mortgage at 4% interest (Fannie Mae).
- **Source of confusion:** The prevalence of the 30-year mortgage in the market and its widespread promotion by lenders contribute to its perceived superiority.

- **Myth:** Some borrowers believe that refinancing their mortgage will always result in lower monthly payments.
- **Fact:** Refinancing can sometimes increase monthly payments, especially if the new loan has a shorter term or a higher interest rate, as seen in the case of a borrower refinancing from a 30-year to a 15-year mortgage (Bankrate).
- **Source of confusion:** The myth arises from the assumption that refinancing always leads to lower interest rates and lower monthly payments, without considering the impact of the loan term.

- **Myth:** Many people think that prepayment penalties are a standard feature of all mortgages.
- **Fact:** Prepayment penalties are not common in most mortgages, and borrowers should carefully review their loan terms to determine if such a penalty applies, as noted by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
- **Source of confusion:** The myth persists due to the lack of transparency in loan terms and the complexity of mortgage contracts.

- **Myth:** Some borrowers believe that mortgage amortization is only relevant for fixed-rate loans.
- **Fact:** Amortization schedules are also relevant for adjustable-rate loans, as they can help borrowers understand the potential impact of interest rate changes on their monthly payments, as demonstrated by the example of an adjustable-rate mortgage with a 5/1 ARM (Zillow).
- **Source of confusion:** The myth stems from the perception that adjustable-rate loans are more complex and do not follow a standard amortization schedule.
