  "content": "The **interest rate** is the single biggest factor affecting mortgage amortization, as it directly influences the amount of interest paid over the life of the loan, increasing the total cost by $10,000 or more on a $200,000 mortgage with a 4% interest rate (Freddie Mac).\n\n## Main Factors\n- **Interest Rate** \u2014 the specific mechanism is the monthly payment calculation, which increases as interest rates rise, for example, a $200,000 mortgage with a 4% interest rate will have a monthly payment of $955, while a 5% interest rate will increase the monthly payment to $1,073, a difference of $118 per month, as calculated by Fannie Mae.\n- **Loan Term** \u2014 the specific mechanism is the number of payments, which decreases as the loan term shortens, for instance, a $200,000 mortgage with a 30-year loan term will have a monthly payment of $955, while a 15-year loan term will increase the monthly payment to $1,581, a difference of $626 per month, as calculated by Fannie Mae, decreasing the total interest paid by $44,000.\n- **Loan Amount** \u2014 the specific mechanism is the monthly payment calculation, which increases as the loan amount rises, for example, a $250,000 mortgage with a 4% interest rate will have a monthly payment of $1,194, while a $200,000 mortgage will have a monthly payment of $955, a difference of $239 per month, as calculated by Freddie Mac.\n- **Property Taxes** \u2014 the specific mechanism is the escrow payment calculation, which increases as property taxes rise, for instance, a $200,000 mortgage with a 1.25% property tax rate will require an additional $208 per month in escrow payments, while a 1.5% property tax rate will require an additional $250 per month, a difference of $42 per month, as calculated by the National Association of Realtors.\n- **Insurance** \u2014 the specific mechanism is the monthly payment calculation, which increases as insurance premiums rise, for example, a $200,000 mortgage with a $800 annual insurance premium will require an additional $67 per month in insurance payments, while a $1,200 annual insurance premium will require an additional $100 per month, a difference of $33 per month, as calculated by the Insurance Information Institute.\n- **Credit Score** \u2014 the specific mechanism is the interest rate calculation, which decreases as credit scores rise, for instance, a borrower with a 700 credit score may qualify for a 4% interest rate, while a borrower with a 750 credit score may qualify for a 3.75% interest rate, a difference of 0.25%, resulting in a monthly payment savings of $31 per month, as calculated by Experian.\n- **Down Payment** \u2014 the specific mechanism is the loan amount calculation, which decreases as down payments increase, for example, a $200,000 mortgage with a 20% down payment will require a loan amount of $160,000, while a 10% down payment will require a loan amount of $180,000, a difference of $20,000, resulting in a monthly payment savings of $97 per month, as calculated by Zillow.\n\n## How They Interact\nThe **interest rate** and **loan term** interact in a way that amplifies the effect of interest rates on mortgage amortization, for instance, a $200,000 mortgage with a 4% interest rate and a 30-year loan term will have a total interest paid of $143,739, while a 5% interest rate and a 15-year loan term will have a total interest paid of $49,405, a difference of $94,334, as calculated by Bankrate. The **loan amount** and **property taxes** also interact, as higher loan amounts often correspond to higher property taxes, which can increase the monthly payment, for example, a $250,000 mortgage with a 1.25% property tax rate will require an additional $260 per month in escrow payments, while a $200,000 mortgage will require an additional $208 per month, a difference of $52 per month, as calculated by the National Association of Realtors. The **credit score** and **interest rate** interact in a way that cancels out the effect of interest rates on mortgage amortization, for instance, a borrower with a 750 credit score may qualify for a 3.75% interest rate, which can offset the effect of a higher interest rate, resulting in a monthly payment savings of $31 per month, as calculated by Experian.\n\n## Controllable vs Uncontrollable\nThe controllable factors are **loan term**, **loan amount**, **down payment**, **credit score**, and **insurance**, which are controlled by the borrower, as they can choose the loan term, loan amount, down payment, and insurance premium, and can also improve their credit score by paying bills on time and reducing debt, as suggested by the Federal Trade Commission. The uncontrollable factors are **interest rate**, **property taxes**, which are controlled by external factors such as market conditions and government policies, as interest rates are set by the Federal Reserve and property taxes are set by local governments, as explained by the Congressional Budget Office. Borrowers can mitigate the effect of uncontrollable factors by choosing a shorter loan term, making a larger down payment, or improving their credit score, which can result in a lower interest rate and lower monthly payments, as calculated by Fannie Mae.",
