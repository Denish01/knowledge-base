# What Diversification Depends On

Diversification depends on **Access to Multiple Asset Classes**, as without it, investors are left vulnerable to market fluctuations, exemplified by the 2008 financial crisis where investors heavily invested in subprime mortgage-backed securities suffered significant losses.

## Key Dependencies
- **Access to Multiple Asset Classes** — required to minimize risk and maximize returns, as seen in the 2008 financial crisis where lack of diversification led to significant losses for investors heavily invested in subprime mortgage-backed securities. 
- **Economic Stability** — necessary for diversification to be effective, as economic instability can lead to market volatility, making it difficult to predict asset performance, as witnessed in Argentina's 2001 economic crisis where investors struggled to navigate the unstable market.
- **Regulatory Environment** — a stable regulatory environment is necessary for diversification, as over-regulation or under-regulation can hinder investment, as seen in the case of China's strict capital controls which limited foreign investment.
- **Financial Literacy** — essential for making informed investment decisions, as lack of financial literacy can lead to poor investment choices, such as the case of investors who lost money in the Bernie Madoff Ponzi scheme due to lack of understanding of the investment.
- **Risk Management** — necessary to mitigate potential losses, as poor risk management can lead to significant losses, as seen in the case of Long-Term Capital Management, which collapsed in 1998 due to poor risk management.

## Priority Order
The dependencies can be ranked in the following order:
- **Access to Multiple Asset Classes**, as it is the most critical dependency, without which diversification is not possible, as seen in the 2008 financial crisis.
- **Economic Stability**, as it is necessary for predicting asset performance and making informed investment decisions, as witnessed in Argentina's 2001 economic crisis.
- **Regulatory Environment**, as it can hinder or facilitate investment, as seen in the case of China's strict capital controls.
- **Financial Literacy**, as it is necessary for making informed investment decisions, as seen in the case of investors who lost money in the Bernie Madoff Ponzi scheme.
- **Risk Management**, as it is necessary to mitigate potential losses, but it is less critical than the other dependencies, as seen in the case of Long-Term Capital Management.

## Common Gaps
People often overlook the importance of **Economic Stability** and **Regulatory Environment**, assuming that they are always stable and favorable, which can lead to significant losses, as witnessed in the cases of Argentina's 2001 economic crisis and China's strict capital controls. Another common gap is the assumption that **Financial Literacy** is not necessary, as investors can rely on financial advisors, which can lead to poor investment choices, as seen in the case of investors who lost money in the Bernie Madoff Ponzi scheme.
