# What Is Diversification?

Diversification is a strategy used to manage risk by spreading investments across different asset classes, industries, or geographic regions, a concept rooted in **portfolio theory**, which was first introduced by Harry Markowitz in 1952.

## Definition
Diversification refers to the allocation of investments to reduce risk by investing in different types of assets, industries, or regions, with the goal of increasing potential returns while minimizing losses, as described by Markowitz's **modern portfolio theory**.

## How It Works
The process of diversification involves allocating investments across a range of assets, such as stocks, bonds, real estate, or commodities, to reduce the risk of any one investment affecting the overall portfolio. For instance, a portfolio with a mix of **low-risk bonds**, such as US Treasury bonds, and **high-risk stocks**, such as those in the technology sector, can help to balance risk and potential returns. According to **Ricardo's comparative advantage model**, 1817, diversification can also be applied to international trade, where countries specialize in producing goods in which they have a comparative advantage, thereby reducing their reliance on any one industry or market.

Diversification can be achieved through various mechanisms, including **index funds**, which track a specific market index, such as the S&P 500, and **mutual funds**, which pool investments from multiple investors to invest in a diversified portfolio. The **capital asset pricing model** (CAPM) also provides a framework for understanding the relationship between risk and return, and how diversification can help to optimize portfolio performance. For example, Boeing produces ~800 aircraft annually (Boeing annual report), and its stock is often included in diversified portfolios to spread risk across different industries.

The benefits of diversification can be seen in the performance of companies such as **3M**, which has a diversified portfolio of products, including adhesives, abrasives, and electronics, and has been able to maintain a stable revenue stream despite fluctuations in individual markets. Diversification can also be applied to **emerging markets**, such as those in Asia and Latin America, where investing in a range of countries and industries can help to reduce risk and increase potential returns.

## Key Components
- **Asset allocation**: the process of dividing investments among different asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, and real estate, to achieve a desired balance of risk and return.
- **Risk management**: the process of identifying and mitigating potential risks, such as market volatility or credit risk, through diversification and other strategies.
- **Portfolio rebalancing**: the process of periodically reviewing and adjusting a portfolio to ensure that it remains aligned with an investor's goals and risk tolerance.
- **Correlation**: the measure of how closely the returns of different assets move together, with lower correlation indicating greater diversification benefits.
- **Tracking error**: the measure of how closely a portfolio's returns track a benchmark index, with lower tracking error indicating greater diversification benefits.
- **Diversification ratio**: the measure of the number of assets in a portfolio relative to the number of assets in a benchmark index, with a higher ratio indicating greater diversification.

## Common Misconceptions
- **Myth:** Diversification always leads to lower returns — **Fact:** Diversification can lead to higher returns over the long term by reducing risk and increasing potential returns, as seen in the performance of companies such as **Johnson & Johnson**, which has a diversified portfolio of pharmaceutical and consumer products.
- **Myth:** Diversification is only necessary for large investors — **Fact:** Diversification is important for investors of all sizes, as it can help to reduce risk and increase potential returns, regardless of the size of the investment portfolio, as described by **Burton Malkiel's random walk theory**.
- **Myth:** Diversification is a one-time process — **Fact:** Diversification is an ongoing process that requires regular monitoring and adjustment to ensure that a portfolio remains aligned with an investor's goals and risk tolerance, as recommended by **David Swensen's investment approach**.
- **Myth:** Diversification is only relevant to equity investments — **Fact:** Diversification is relevant to all types of investments, including bonds, real estate, and commodities, as seen in the **CalPERS investment portfolio**, which includes a diversified range of asset classes.

## In Practice
A concrete example of diversification in practice can be seen in the investment portfolio of **CalPERS**, the California Public Employees' Retirement System, which has a diversified portfolio of ~$400 billion in assets, including stocks, bonds, real estate, and private equity (CalPERS annual report). The portfolio is designed to provide a stable return over the long term, while minimizing risk through diversification across different asset classes and geographic regions. For instance, CalPERS has invested in companies such as **Procter & Gamble**, which has a diversified portfolio of consumer products, and **Coca-Cola**, which has a diversified portfolio of beverage products, to spread risk across different industries and markets.
