# Types of Diversification

There are three primary categories of diversification, which are organized based on the type of risk being mitigated: **Geographic Diversification**, **Product Diversification**, and **Industry Diversification**.

## Main Categories
- **Geographic Diversification** — involves expanding into new geographic markets to reduce dependence on a single region, characterized by differences in consumer behavior, regulatory environments, and economic conditions, as seen in Coca-Cola's expansion into China, where it has established a strong presence with over 100 factories and a diverse product portfolio.
- **Product Diversification** — entails offering a range of products to reduce reliance on a single product, marked by differences in production processes, target markets, and competitive landscapes, exemplified by 3M's product lineup, which includes Post-it notes, Scotch tape, and Thinsulate insulation, among others.
- **Industry Diversification** — involves operating in multiple industries to minimize exposure to industry-specific risks, distinguished by distinct business models, supply chains, and customer bases, as illustrated by Berkshire Hathaway's conglomerate structure, which spans insurance (Geico), retail (Nebraska Furniture Mart), and manufacturing (Lubrizol).

## Comparison Table
| Category | Cost | Scale | Speed | Risk |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Geographic Diversification** | High (market research, regulatory compliance) | Large (establishing new operations) | Medium (6-12 months) | Medium (currency fluctuations, cultural differences) |
| **Product Diversification** | Medium (product development, marketing) | Medium (expanding product lines) | Fast (3-6 months) | Low (shared resources, synergies) |
| **Industry Diversification** | Very High (acquisitions, integration) | Very Large (complex operations) | Slow (1-2 years) | High (industry disruption, cultural integration) |

## How They Relate
Pairs of categories often overlap or feed into each other, such as **Geographic Diversification** and **Product Diversification**, where expanding into new markets may require adapting products to local tastes, as seen in McDonald's offering region-specific menu items, like the Teriyaki McBurger in Japan. Conversely, **Product Diversification** can facilitate **Industry Diversification** by providing a platform for entering new industries, as in the case of Apple's expansion from personal computers to mobile devices and music streaming. **Industry Diversification** and **Geographic Diversification** can also be interconnected, as a company may enter new industries in specific geographic regions, such as General Electric's presence in the healthcare industry in Europe. These interactions highlight the complexity and interdependence of diversification strategies, where companies must navigate multiple categories to achieve their goals.
