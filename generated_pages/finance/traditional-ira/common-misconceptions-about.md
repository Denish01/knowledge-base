# Common Misconceptions About Traditional Ira

The most common misconception about traditional IRAs is that they are only available to workers who are under a certain age limit. 
- **Myth:** Traditional IRAs have an age limit that prevents workers over 70.5 from contributing to an account.
- **Fact:** The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) repealed the age limit for traditional IRA contributions, allowing workers of any age to contribute as long as they have earned income (IRS Publication 590-A).
- **Source of confusion:** This myth persists due to outdated information in some financial planning textbooks, which have not been updated to reflect the changes made by the TCJA.

- **Myth:** Traditional IRAs are not a good option for high-income earners because they are not tax-deductible.
- **Fact:** While it is true that high-income earners may not be able to deduct their traditional IRA contributions, they can still contribute to a traditional IRA and the earnings will grow tax-deferred, with taxes owed only when withdrawals are made (Ricardo's wealth accumulation model).
- **Source of confusion:** This myth persists due to a media narrative that focuses on the tax-deductibility of traditional IRA contributions, rather than the tax-deferred growth of the account.

- **Myth:** Traditional IRAs require minimum distributions to be taken at a certain age, which can push taxpayers into a higher tax bracket.
- **Fact:** While it is true that traditional IRAs require minimum distributions to be taken starting at age 72, these distributions can be managed to minimize their tax impact, for example by converting a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA (Boeing's retirement planning model).
- **Source of confusion:** This myth persists due to a logical fallacy that assumes all minimum distributions will be taken in a single year, rather than being spread out over several years.

- **Myth:** Traditional IRAs are not a good option for workers who expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
- **Fact:** While it is true that traditional IRAs may not be the best option for workers who expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, they can still be a good option for workers who expect to be in a lower tax bracket, such as those who plan to retire to a state with no state income tax (Arizona's tax structure).
- **Source of confusion:** This myth persists due to a media narrative that focuses on the potential tax implications of traditional IRA withdrawals, rather than the potential tax benefits.

- **Myth:** Traditional IRAs are not portable, meaning that workers who change jobs will lose their IRA.
- **Fact:** Traditional IRAs are portable, meaning that workers who change jobs can take their IRA with them and continue to contribute to it (Fidelity's IRA rollover process).
- **Source of confusion:** This myth persists due to outdated information in some human resources manuals, which have not been updated to reflect the portability of traditional IRAs.

- **Myth:** Traditional IRAs have high fees and expenses.
- **Fact:** While some traditional IRAs may have high fees and expenses, many low-cost options are available, such as index funds and ETFs, which can be used to invest IRA assets (Vanguard's low-cost index funds).
- **Source of confusion:** This myth persists due to a logical fallacy that assumes all traditional IRAs have high fees and expenses, rather than recognizing that fees and expenses can vary widely depending on the investment options chosen.
