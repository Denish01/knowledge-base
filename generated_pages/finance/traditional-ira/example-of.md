# Example of Traditional Ira

## Definition
Traditional Individual Retirement Account (Traditional IRA) is a type of savings account that allows individuals to save for retirement while reducing their taxable income, introduced by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) of 1974.

## How It Works
A Traditional IRA works by allowing individuals to contribute a portion of their income to the account on a tax-deductible basis, with the contributions and earnings growing tax-deferred until withdrawal. The **Internal Revenue Service (IRS)** sets annual contribution limits, which are $6,000 in 2022, with an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution allowed for individuals 50 years or older. Contributions to a Traditional IRA may be tax-deductible, reducing an individual's taxable income, and the funds grow tax-deferred, meaning the individual will not pay taxes on the investment earnings until withdrawal.

The funds in a Traditional IRA can be invested in a variety of assets, such as **stocks**, **bonds**, and **mutual funds**, allowing individuals to create a diversified portfolio. The **Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)** regulates the investment products available in Traditional IRAs, ensuring that individuals have access to a range of investment options. When an individual withdraws funds from a Traditional IRA, the withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income, and the individual may be subject to a 10% penalty if the withdrawal is made before age 59 1/2, unless an exception applies, such as a first-time home purchase or qualified education expenses.

Traditional IRAs also have **Required Minimum Distribution (RMD)** rules, which require individuals to take minimum distributions from the account starting at age 72, based on life expectancy tables provided by the **IRS**. This ensures that individuals do not accumulate tax-deferred savings indefinitely and that the government can collect taxes on the earnings. The RMD amount is calculated based on the account balance and the individual's life expectancy, and failure to take the RMD can result in a 50% penalty on the amount that should have been withdrawn.

## Key Components
- **Contribution limits**: The annual limit on the amount that can be contributed to a Traditional IRA, which is $6,000 in 2022, and the additional $1,000 catch-up contribution allowed for individuals 50 years or older, affect the amount that can be saved and the tax deductions available.
- **Tax-deductible contributions**: The ability to deduct contributions from taxable income reduces an individual's tax liability, allowing them to save more for retirement, and the deductibility of contributions is phased out at higher income levels.
- **Tax-deferred growth**: The ability of the investments in a Traditional IRA to grow without being subject to taxes until withdrawal allows the account to accumulate more wealth over time, as the earnings are reinvested and compound.
- **Investment options**: The range of investment products available in Traditional IRAs, such as **stocks**, **bonds**, and **mutual funds**, allows individuals to create a diversified portfolio and manage risk, with the **SEC** regulating the investment products to ensure their safety and soundness.
- **Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)**: The rules requiring individuals to take minimum distributions from a Traditional IRA starting at age 72, based on life expectancy tables provided by the **IRS**, ensure that individuals do not accumulate tax-deferred savings indefinitely and that the government can collect taxes on the earnings.
- **Penalty for early withdrawal**: The 10% penalty on withdrawals made before age 59 1/2, unless an exception applies, discourages individuals from using the funds for non-retirement purposes and ensures that the account is used for its intended purpose.

## Common Misconceptions
- **Myth:** Traditional IRAs are only available to individuals with high incomes. **Fact:** Traditional IRAs are available to anyone with earned income, regardless of income level, although the deductibility of contributions is phased out at higher income levels.
- **Myth:** Traditional IRAs have no fees. **Fact:** Traditional IRAs may have fees associated with the investment products, such as **management fees** and **administrative fees**, which can range from 0.05% to 2.00% of the account balance annually, depending on the investment products and the provider.
- **Myth:** Traditional IRAs are the same as **Roth IRAs**. **Fact:** Traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs have different tax treatment, with Traditional IRAs allowing tax-deductible contributions and tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth and withdrawals, with contributions made with after-tax dollars.
- **Myth:** Traditional IRAs can be used for any purpose. **Fact:** Traditional IRAs are intended for retirement savings, and withdrawals before age 59 1/2 may be subject to a 10% penalty, unless an exception applies, such as a first-time home purchase or qualified education expenses.

## In Practice
In the United States, individuals such as employees of **Boeing** or **Microsoft** can contribute to a Traditional IRA through their employer's benefits program or by opening an account with a financial institution, such as **Fidelity** or **Vanguard**. For example, an individual earning $60,000 per year could contribute $6,000 to a Traditional IRA in 2022, reducing their taxable income to $54,000, and the funds could be invested in a variety of assets, such as **stocks** or **bonds**, with the earnings growing tax-deferred until withdrawal. The individual could also take advantage of the **catch-up contribution** provision, allowing them to contribute an additional $1,000 to the account, and the **SEC** would regulate the investment products available in the Traditional IRA to ensure their safety and soundness.
