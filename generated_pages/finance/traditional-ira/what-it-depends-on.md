# What Traditional Ira Depends On

Income eligibility is the most critical dependency for traditional IRA contributions, as it directly affects an individual's ability to contribute to a traditional IRA. 
The **income threshold** — exceeding this limit reduces or eliminates the ability to deduct contributions from taxable income, and without it, individuals may inadvertently exceed the threshold and lose the tax benefits associated with traditional IRA contributions. For example, in 2019, the IRS reported that many taxpayers lost their ability to deduct traditional IRA contributions due to income above the threshold, resulting in a significant increase in taxable income.

## Key Dependencies
- **Age limit** — exceeding 70.5 years old makes it mandatory to take required minimum distributions (RMDs), and without it, individuals may fail to take RMDs, resulting in penalties, such as the case of an 80-year-old taxpayer who was fined for not taking RMDs from her traditional IRA.
- **Tax filing status** — being married and filing separately can reduce or eliminate the ability to deduct contributions, and without it, married couples may overstate their deductions, as seen in a 2018 tax court case where a couple was denied deductions due to their filing status.
- **Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI)** — exceeding certain MAGI thresholds can reduce or eliminate the ability to deduct contributions, and without it, individuals may lose the tax benefits associated with traditional IRA contributions, such as the case of a high-income taxpayer who lost their ability to deduct contributions due to exceeding the MAGI threshold.
- **Employer-sponsored retirement plan participation** — participating in an employer-sponsored plan can reduce or eliminate the ability to deduct contributions, and without it, individuals may overstate their deductions, as seen in a 2020 IRS report that found many taxpayers who participated in employer-sponsored plans were incorrectly claiming deductions for traditional IRA contributions.

## Priority Order
1. **Income eligibility** is the most critical dependency, as it directly affects an individual's ability to contribute to a traditional IRA, and without it, individuals may lose the tax benefits associated with traditional IRA contributions.
2. **MAGI** is the second most critical dependency, as it can reduce or eliminate the ability to deduct contributions, and exceeding certain MAGI thresholds can result in significant tax liabilities, such as the case of a high-income taxpayer who owed back taxes due to exceeding the MAGI threshold.
3. **Tax filing status** is the third most critical dependency, as it can reduce or eliminate the ability to deduct contributions, and incorrect filing status can result in penalties and fines, such as the case of a couple who was denied deductions due to their filing status.
4. **Age limit** is the fourth most critical dependency, as exceeding 70.5 years old makes it mandatory to take RMDs, and failing to take RMDs can result in penalties, such as the case of an 80-year-old taxpayer who was fined for not taking RMDs from her traditional IRA.
5. **Employer-sponsored retirement plan participation** is the least critical dependency, as it only affects the ability to deduct contributions, and individuals can still contribute to a traditional IRA even if they participate in an employer-sponsored plan, although they may not be able to deduct their contributions.

## Common Gaps
- Many people overlook the **MAGI threshold**, assuming that their income is below the threshold, and this oversight can result in significant tax liabilities, such as the case of a high-income taxpayer who owed back taxes due to exceeding the MAGI threshold.
- Others take for granted the **tax filing status**, assuming that their filing status does not affect their ability to deduct contributions, and this assumption can result in penalties and fines, such as the case of a couple who was denied deductions due to their filing status.
