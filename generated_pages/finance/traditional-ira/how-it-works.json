  "content": "Traditional **Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs)** work by allowing individuals to contribute a portion of their income to a tax-deferred investment account, which grows over time and provides a source of income in retirement. The core mechanism involves individuals contributing to an IRA, the funds being invested and growing, and the individual withdrawing the funds in retirement, with the **Internal Revenue Service (IRS)** regulating the rules and limits of these accounts.\n\n## The Mechanism\nThe traditional IRA mechanism is driven by tax-deferred growth, where contributions are made with **pre-tax dollars**, reducing the individual's taxable income, and the funds grow tax-free until withdrawal. The process involves the individual contributing up to **$6,000** annually, with an additional **$1,000** catch-up contribution allowed for individuals over 50, and the funds being invested in a variety of assets, such as stocks, bonds, or mutual funds.\n\n## Step-by-Step\n1. An individual contributes up to **$6,000** annually to a traditional IRA, which reduces their taxable income, resulting in a lower tax liability, with the average tax savings being around **15%** of the contribution amount.\n2. The contributed funds are invested in a variety of assets, such as stocks, bonds, or mutual funds, with an average annual return of around **7%**, causing the account balance to grow over time.\n3. The funds in the IRA grow tax-free, meaning that the individual does not pay taxes on the investment gains, resulting in a larger account balance, with the average IRA balance being around **$100,000** after 10 years of contributions.\n4. When the individual reaches age **59 1/2**, they can begin withdrawing funds from the IRA without penalty, with the withdrawals being taxed as ordinary income, resulting in a tax liability of around **20%** of the withdrawal amount.\n5. The individual must take **Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)** from the IRA starting at age **72**, which are taxable as ordinary income, resulting in a tax liability of around **25%** of the RMD amount.\n6. The IRA funds can be used to support the individual's living expenses in retirement, with the average retiree withdrawing around **4%** of their IRA balance annually.\n\n## Key Components\n- **Contributions**: The individual's contributions to the IRA, which are made with pre-tax dollars and reduce taxable income.\n- **Investments**: The variety of assets, such as stocks, bonds, or mutual funds, in which the IRA funds are invested, which grow the account balance over time.\n- **Tax-deferred growth**: The tax-free growth of the IRA funds, which allows the account balance to grow larger over time.\n- **Withdrawals**: The individual's withdrawals from the IRA, which are taxable as ordinary income and can be used to support living expenses in retirement.\n\n## Common Questions\nWhat happens if an individual withdraws funds from an IRA before age **59 1/2**? They will be subject to a **10%** penalty, in addition to paying taxes on the withdrawal amount. \nWhat is the maximum amount that can be contributed to an IRA annually? The maximum contribution amount is **$6,000**, with an additional **$1,000** catch-up contribution allowed for individuals over 50. \nCan an IRA be inherited by a beneficiary? Yes, an IRA can be inherited by a beneficiary, who will be subject to the same tax rules and regulations as the original account owner. \nHow do RMDs affect the tax liability of an IRA owner? RMDs increase the tax liability of an IRA owner, as they are taxable as ordinary income, resulting in a tax liability of around **25%** of the RMD amount.",
