# How Traditional Ira Works

Traditional **Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs)** work by allowing individuals to contribute a portion of their income to a tax-deferred investment account, which grows over time and provides a source of income in retirement. The core mechanism involves individuals contributing to an IRA, the funds being invested and growing, and the individual withdrawing the funds in retirement, with the **Internal Revenue Service (IRS)** regulating the rules and limits of these accounts.

## The Mechanism
The traditional IRA mechanism is driven by tax-deferred growth, where contributions are made with **pre-tax dollars**, reducing the individual's taxable income, and the funds grow tax-free until withdrawal. The process involves the individual contributing up to **$6,000** annually, with an additional **$1,000** catch-up contribution allowed for individuals over 50, and the funds being invested in a variety of assets, such as stocks, bonds, or mutual funds.

## Step-by-Step
1. An individual contributes up to **$6,000** annually to a traditional IRA, which reduces their taxable income, resulting in a lower tax liability, with the average tax savings being around **15%** of the contribution amount.
2. The contributed funds are invested in a variety of assets, such as stocks, bonds, or mutual funds, with an average annual return of around **7%**, causing the account balance to grow over time.
3. The funds in the IRA grow tax-free, meaning that the individual does not pay taxes on the investment gains, resulting in a larger account balance, with the average IRA balance being around **$100,000** after 10 years of contributions.
4. When the individual reaches age **59 1/2**, they can begin withdrawing funds from the IRA without penalty, with the withdrawals being taxed as ordinary income, resulting in a tax liability of around **20%** of the withdrawal amount.
5. The individual must take **Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)** from the IRA starting at age **72**, which are taxable as ordinary income, resulting in a tax liability of around **25%** of the RMD amount.
6. The IRA funds can be used to support the individual's living expenses in retirement, with the average retiree withdrawing around **4%** of their IRA balance annually.

## Key Components
- **Contributions**: The individual's contributions to the IRA, which are made with pre-tax dollars and reduce taxable income.

- **Tax-deferred growth**: The tax-free growth of the IRA funds, which allows the account balance to grow larger over time.
- **Withdrawals**: The individual's withdrawals from the IRA, which are taxable as ordinary income and can be used to support living expenses in retirement.
