  "content": "There are two primary categories of Traditional IRAs, distinguished by their contribution and deduction rules: **Deductible Traditional IRA** and **Nondeductible Traditional IRA**.\n\n## Main Categories\n- **Deductible Traditional IRA** \u2014 a type of Traditional IRA where contributions are tax-deductible, and earnings grow tax-deferred, with **Fidelity Investments** offering this type of IRA account.\n- **Nondeductible Traditional IRA** \u2014 a type of Traditional IRA where contributions are made with after-tax dollars and are not tax-deductible, but earnings still grow tax-deferred, with **Charles Schwab** offering this type of IRA account.\n- **Rollover Traditional IRA** \u2014 a type of Traditional IRA that allows individuals to transfer assets from a previous employer-sponsored retirement plan, such as a **401(k)**, to an IRA account, with **Vanguard** offering this type of IRA account.\n- **Inherited Traditional IRA** \u2014 a type of Traditional IRA that is inherited by a beneficiary, with **T. Rowe Price** offering guidance on managing inherited IRAs.\n\n## Comparison Table\n| Category | Contribution Limit | Tax-Deductibility | Income Requirement |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Deductible Traditional IRA** | $6,000 (2022) | Tax-deductible | Phased out at $76,000-$91,000 (2022) |\n| **Nondeductible Traditional IRA** | $6,000 (2022) | Not tax-deductible | No income limit |\n| **Rollover Traditional IRA** | No limit | Tax-deductible (if eligible) | No income limit |\n| **Inherited Traditional IRA** | N/A | Not tax-deductible | N/A |\n\n## How They Relate\nThe **Deductible Traditional IRA** and **Nondeductible Traditional IRA** are often confused due to their similar names, but they have distinct tax implications. The **Rollover Traditional IRA** is commonly used in conjunction with a **Deductible Traditional IRA**, as individuals may roll over assets from a previous employer-sponsored plan to a **Deductible Traditional IRA** account. The **Inherited Traditional IRA** is a separate category that is not directly related to the other types, but rather is a result of inheriting an IRA account from a deceased individual. **Fidelity Investments** and **Charles Schwab** often provide guidance on managing **Inherited Traditional IRAs**, while **Vanguard** specializes in **Rollover Traditional IRAs**. Additionally, **T. Rowe Price** offers investment options for all types of Traditional IRAs, including **Deductible Traditional IRA** and **Nondeductible Traditional IRA** accounts.",
