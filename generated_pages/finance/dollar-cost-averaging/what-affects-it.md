# What Affects Dollar Cost Averaging

Market volatility is the single biggest factor affecting **dollar cost averaging**, as it directly influences the purchase price of assets and can lead to significant variations in the overall cost of investment.

## Main Factors
- **Time horizon** — the longer the investment period, the more **dollar cost averaging** can reduce the impact of market fluctuations, increasing the potential for higher returns, as seen in the case of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, which has a long-term approach and has averaged around 20% annual returns over the past few decades.
- **Investment frequency** — more frequent investments can decrease the overall cost of investment by reducing the impact of market volatility, as demonstrated by the Vanguard 500 Index Fund, which has a low average cost per share due to its daily investment schedule.
- **Market trends** — a bull market can increase the cost of investment, while a bear market can decrease it, as observed in the 2008 financial crisis, where the S&P 500 index fell by around 38%, resulting in lower purchase prices for investors using **dollar cost averaging**.
- **Transaction costs** — high fees associated with buying and selling assets can decrease the effectiveness of **dollar cost averaging**, as seen in the case of actively managed funds, which often have higher expense ratios, such as the Fidelity Magellan Fund, with an expense ratio of around 0.77%.
- **Asset allocation** — the diversification of investments across different asset classes can reduce the risk associated with **dollar cost averaging**, as illustrated by the portfolio of Ray Dalio's Bridgewater Associates, which allocates assets across a range of markets, including stocks, bonds, and commodities.
- **Inflation** — high inflation can decrease the purchasing power of investments, making **dollar cost averaging** less effective, as experienced in the 1970s, when inflation reached around 14% in the United States, eroding the value of investments.
- **Interest rates** — low interest rates can increase the attractiveness of **dollar cost averaging**, as investors seek higher returns, as seen in the post-2008 period, when interest rates were kept low by central banks, leading to increased investment in the stock market.

## How They Interact
The interaction between **time horizon** and **market trends** can amplify the effects of **dollar cost averaging**, as a longer investment period can help ride out market fluctuations, resulting in higher returns, as demonstrated by the investment portfolio of Peter Lynch, which averaged around 29% annual returns over a 13-year period. The combination of **investment frequency** and **transaction costs** can cancel each other out, as higher fees can offset the benefits of frequent investments, as seen in the case of high-frequency trading, where the costs of frequent buying and selling can negate any potential gains. The pairing of **asset allocation** and **inflation** can also have a significant impact, as a diversified portfolio can help mitigate the effects of inflation, as illustrated by the investment strategy of the Yale Endowment, which allocates assets across a range of markets, including real estate and commodities, to reduce the impact of inflation.

## Controllable vs Uncontrollable
The controllable factors affecting **dollar cost averaging** include:
- **Investment frequency**, controlled by the investor, who can choose to invest daily, weekly, or monthly
- **Asset allocation**, controlled by the investor or investment manager, who can diversify the portfolio across different asset classes
- **Transaction costs**, controlled by the investor or investment manager, who can choose low-cost index funds or negotiate lower fees with brokers
The uncontrollable factors include:
- **Market trends**, influenced by a range of economic and geopolitical events
- **Inflation**, influenced by monetary policy and economic conditions
- **Interest rates**, set by central banks and influenced by economic conditions
- **Time horizon**, influenced by the investor's personal circumstances and goals
- **Market volatility**, influenced by a range of factors, including economic indicators and geopolitical events.
