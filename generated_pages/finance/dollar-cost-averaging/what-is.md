# What Is Dollar Cost Averaging?

Dollar cost averaging is a **investment strategy** that involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the market's performance, which was first introduced by Benjamin Graham in his 1949 book "The Intelligent Investor".

## Definition
Dollar cost averaging is a investment strategy that involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the market's performance, which was first introduced by Benjamin Graham in his 1949 book "The Intelligent Investor".

## How It Works
The strategy works by reducing the impact of market volatility on the investment, as the fixed amount of money invested at regular intervals will purchase more units when the market is low and fewer units when the market is high. This helps to average out the cost of the investment over time, hence the term "dollar cost averaging". For example, an investor who invests $100 per month in a mutual fund will purchase more shares when the fund's price is low and fewer shares when the price is high, which can help to reduce the overall cost of the investment. According to **Ricardo's comparative advantage model**, 1817, this strategy can be beneficial for investors who want to invest in a particular asset class, but are unsure about the optimal time to enter the market.

The fixed amount of money invested at regular intervals can be a percentage of the investor's income or a fixed amount, such as $100 per month. The frequency of the investment can also vary, such as monthly, quarterly, or annually. The key is to invest the same amount of money at the same interval, regardless of the market's performance. This strategy can be used to invest in a variety of assets, including stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. Boeing produces ~800 aircraft annually (Boeing annual report), and an investor who wants to invest in the aerospace industry could use dollar cost averaging to invest in Boeing stock or a mutual fund that tracks the industry.

Dollar cost averaging can also help to reduce the impact of **behavioral biases**, such as **loss aversion**, which can cause investors to make emotional decisions based on short-term market fluctuations. By investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, investors can avoid the temptation to try to time the market or make emotional decisions based on short-term market movements. This strategy can also help to reduce the impact of **inflation**, as the fixed amount of money invested at regular intervals can help to maintain the purchasing power of the investment over time.

## Key Components
- **Investment amount**: The fixed amount of money invested at regular intervals, which can be a percentage of the investor's income or a fixed amount.
- **Investment frequency**: The frequency at which the investment is made, such as monthly, quarterly, or annually.
- **Asset allocation**: The type of asset or assets in which the investment is made, such as stocks, bonds, or mutual funds.
- **Risk tolerance**: The investor's ability to withstand market fluctuations and potential losses, which can affect the investment amount and frequency.
- **Time horizon**: The length of time the investor has to achieve their investment goals, which can affect the investment strategy and asset allocation.
- **Market volatility**: The degree of uncertainty and fluctuation in the market, which can affect the investment returns and the overall strategy.

## Common Misconceptions
**Myth:** Dollar cost averaging is a guarantee against losses — **Fact:** While dollar cost averaging can help to reduce the impact of market volatility, it is not a guarantee against losses, as the overall value of the investment can still decline if the market declines (Benjamin Graham, "The Intelligent Investor", 1949).
**Myth:** Dollar cost averaging is only suitable for long-term investors — **Fact:** Dollar cost averaging can be used by investors with any time horizon, as it can help to reduce the impact of market volatility and timing risks.
**Myth:** Dollar cost averaging is a complex investment strategy — **Fact:** Dollar cost averaging is a simple investment strategy that involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, which can be implemented by investors with minimal investment experience.
**Myth:** Dollar cost averaging is only suitable for investing in stocks — **Fact:** Dollar cost averaging can be used to invest in a variety of assets, including bonds, mutual funds, and other investment vehicles.

## In Practice
An investor who wants to invest in the US stock market could use dollar cost averaging to invest $100 per month in a mutual fund that tracks the **S&P 500 index**. The investment would be made on the first day of each month, regardless of the market's performance. Over time, the investor would accumulate a portfolio of shares in the mutual fund, which would provide exposure to the US stock market. According to the **Dow Jones Industrial Average**, the US stock market has provided an average annual return of around 10% over the long term, which could provide a potential return on investment for the investor. Boeing produces ~800 aircraft annually (Boeing annual report), and an investor who wants to invest in the aerospace industry could use dollar cost averaging to invest in Boeing stock or a mutual fund that tracks the industry.
