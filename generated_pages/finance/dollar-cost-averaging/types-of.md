# Types of Dollar Cost Averaging

There are four primary categories of **Dollar Cost Averaging**, organized by the timing and frequency of investments: **Fixed Interval**, **Fixed Amount**, **Value Averaging**, and **Constant Dollar Plan**, each with distinct characteristics and applications. 

## Main Categories
- **Fixed Interval** — investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the market's performance, as seen in the **Vanguard 500 Index Fund**, which allows investors to invest a fixed amount of money at regular intervals.
- **Fixed Amount** — investing a fixed amount of money at irregular intervals, depending on the market's performance, as practiced by **Warren Buffett**, who has invested fixed amounts of money in the stock market at irregular intervals, taking advantage of market downturns.
- **Value Averaging** — investing a variable amount of money at fixed intervals, with the goal of achieving a target portfolio value, as implemented by **Fidelity Investments**, which offers a value averaging investment option to its clients.
- **Constant Dollar Plan** — investing a fixed amount of money at fixed intervals, with the goal of maintaining a constant dollar value of the investment portfolio, as used by **T. Rowe Price**, which offers a constant dollar plan investment option to its clients.

## Comparison Table
| Category | Investment Frequency | Investment Amount | Risk Level |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Fixed Interval** | Regular | Fixed | Medium |
| **Fixed Amount** | Irregular | Fixed | High |
| **Value Averaging** | Fixed | Variable | Medium |
| **Constant Dollar Plan** | Fixed | Fixed | Low |

## How They Relate
The categories of **Dollar Cost Averaging** often overlap, with **Fixed Interval** and **Value Averaging** being commonly confused, as both involve investing at fixed intervals, but with different investment amounts. **Fixed Amount** and **Constant Dollar Plan** are also related, as both involve investing a fixed amount of money, but with different investment frequencies. For example, an investor using a **Fixed Interval** strategy may also use a **Constant Dollar Plan** to maintain a constant dollar value of their investment portfolio. Similarly, an investor using a **Value Averaging** strategy may also use a **Fixed Amount** strategy to invest a fixed amount of money at irregular intervals. The **Dow Jones Industrial Average** is often used as a benchmark for **Dollar Cost Averaging** strategies, with **Charles Dow**'s portfolio management principles, which emphasize the importance of regular investments, still influencing investment decisions today. Ricardo's comparative advantage model (1817) also supports the idea of **Dollar Cost Averaging**, as it suggests that investors should focus on investing in assets with a comparative advantage, rather than trying to time the market.
