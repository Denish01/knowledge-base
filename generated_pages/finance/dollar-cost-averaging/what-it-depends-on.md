# What Dollar Cost Averaging Depends On

Dollar cost averaging depends on **consistent investment amounts** to reduce the impact of market volatility on investment returns. 
## Key Dependencies
- **Regular investment schedule** — a regular schedule is required to maintain the averaging effect, and without it, the investor may end up trying to time the market, which can lead to poor investment decisions, as seen in the case of the 2008 financial crisis where many investors stopped investing in their 401(k) plans due to market volatility, resulting in missed opportunities for long-term growth.
- **Stable financial situation** — a stable financial situation is necessary to ensure that the investor can continue to invest regularly, and without it, the investor may be forced to withdraw from the market during downturns, such as what happened to many investors during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic who had to withdraw from their investments to cover living expenses.
- **Long-term perspective** — a long-term perspective is required to ride out market fluctuations, and without it, the investor may become discouraged and withdraw from the market during downturns, as seen in the case of the dot-com bubble where many investors pulled out of the market after experiencing significant losses.
- **Low-cost investment options** — low-cost investment options are necessary to minimize fees and maximize returns, and without them, the investor may end up paying high fees that eat into their returns, such as what happens when investing in actively managed funds with high expense ratios, which can be as high as 1.5% or more, according to Vanguard's expense ratio data.
- **Disciplined investment approach** — a disciplined investment approach is required to stick to the investment plan, and without it, the investor may end up making emotional decisions based on market volatility, such as what happened to many investors during the 2010 flash crash where they sold their investments in a panic, resulting in significant losses.
- **Tax-efficient investment strategy** — a tax-efficient investment strategy is necessary to minimize tax liabilities, and without it, the investor may end up paying more in taxes than necessary, such as what happens when investing in tax-inefficient investments like mutual funds with high turnover rates, which can generate significant capital gains taxes, according to data from the Investment Company Institute.

## Priority Order
The dependencies can be ranked in order of priority as follows:
- **Consistent investment amounts**, as this is the foundation of dollar cost averaging and without it, the investor may end up trying to time the market.
- **Regular investment schedule**, as this is necessary to maintain the averaging effect and ensure that the investor is investing regularly.
- **Stable financial situation**, as this is necessary to ensure that the investor can continue to invest regularly and ride out market fluctuations.
- **Long-term perspective**, as this is necessary to ride out market fluctuations and avoid making emotional decisions based on short-term market volatility.
- **Low-cost investment options**, as this is necessary to minimize fees and maximize returns, but is less critical than the first four dependencies.
- **Disciplined investment approach** and **tax-efficient investment strategy**, as these are important but less critical than the first five dependencies, and can be addressed through education and planning.

## Common Gaps
Many investors overlook the importance of **consistent investment amounts** and **regular investment schedule**, assuming that they can simply invest sporadically and still achieve their investment goals, which can lead to poor investment decisions and reduced returns, as seen in the case of investors who try to time the market and end up missing out on significant gains.
