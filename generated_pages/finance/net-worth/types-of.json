  "content": "There are six primary categories of **Net Worth**, distinguished by the source and nature of an individual's or organization's assets, which can be broadly classified into personal, business, and national types. \n## Main Categories\n- **Personal Net Worth** \u2014 the total value of an individual's assets minus their liabilities, distinguishing characteristics include its focus on personal finance and wealth management, as seen in the case of Warren Buffett, who has a personal net worth of over $100 billion (Forbes).\n- **Business Net Worth** \u2014 the total value of a company's assets minus its liabilities, distinguishing characteristics include its focus on corporate finance and valuation, as seen in the case of Apple, which has a business net worth of over $2 trillion (Apple annual report).\n- **National Net Worth** \u2014 the total value of a country's assets minus its liabilities, distinguishing characteristics include its focus on macroeconomic stability and fiscal policy, as seen in the case of Norway, which has a national net worth of over $1 trillion (International Monetary Fund).\n- **Tangible Net Worth** \u2014 the total value of an individual's or organization's physical assets, such as real estate and equipment, distinguishing characteristics include its focus on asset-based lending and collateralized finance, as seen in the case of Boeing, which has a tangible net worth of over $100 billion (Boeing annual report).\n- **Intangible Net Worth** \u2014 the total value of an individual's or organization's non-physical assets, such as patents and trademarks, distinguishing characteristics include its focus on intellectual property and knowledge-based economies, as seen in the case of Google, which has an intangible net worth of over $500 billion (Google annual report).\n- **Adjusted Net Worth** \u2014 the total value of an individual's or organization's assets minus their liabilities, adjusted for inflation and other economic factors, distinguishing characteristics include its focus on real economic value and purchasing power, as seen in the case of the United States, which has an adjusted national net worth of over $100 trillion (Bureau of Economic Analysis).\n\n## Comparison Table\n| Category | Source of Assets | Risk Profile | Liquidity |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Personal Net Worth | Salary, investments, inheritance | High | Low |\n| Business Net Worth | Revenue, investments, debt financing | Medium | Medium |\n| National Net Worth | Tax revenue, natural resources, foreign investments | Low | High |\n| Tangible Net Worth | Physical assets, such as real estate and equipment | Medium | Low |\n| Intangible Net Worth | Intellectual property, such as patents and trademarks | High | Medium |\n| Adjusted Net Worth | Inflation-adjusted assets and liabilities | Low | High |\n\n## How They Relate\nThe categories of **Net Worth** often overlap and feed into each other, with personal net worth influencing business net worth, and national net worth affecting both personal and business net worth, as seen in the case of the 2008 financial crisis, which impacted all three types of net worth. \n- **Personal Net Worth** and **Business Net Worth** are commonly confused, as individuals may use personal assets to finance business ventures, such as entrepreneurs using personal savings to fund startup costs.\n- **National Net Worth** and **Adjusted Net Worth** are closely related, as national net worth is often adjusted for inflation and other economic factors to provide a more accurate picture of a country's economic health, as seen in the case of the United States, which uses adjusted net worth to calculate its national wealth.\n- **Tangible Net Worth** and **Intangible Net Worth** are distinct but related, as tangible assets can be used to secure intangible assets, such as using real estate to collateralize a patent, as seen in the case of tech companies using physical assets to secure intellectual property loans.",
