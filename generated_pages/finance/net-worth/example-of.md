# Example of Net Worth

## Definition
Net worth is the difference between an individual's or company's assets and liabilities, a concept closely related to **financial health** and stability, as described by economists such as Adam Smith in his work on wealth (1776).

## How It Works
The calculation of net worth involves subtracting total liabilities from total assets, which can include **tangible assets** like real estate, vehicles, and equipment, as well as **intangible assets** like patents, copyrights, and goodwill. For instance, Boeing produces ~800 aircraft annually (Boeing annual report) and holds significant assets in its manufacturing facilities and intellectual property, while its liabilities include debt and accounts payable. The net worth of an individual or company can fluctuate over time due to changes in asset values, debt levels, and income.

As net worth increases, so does the ability to invest, save, and weather financial shocks, as described by **Ricardo's comparative advantage model** (1817), which highlights the benefits of allocating resources efficiently. A company like Coca-Cola, with a large and diverse portfolio of assets, including its brand and distribution network, can maintain a high net worth by continually investing in its core business and expanding into new markets. In contrast, a decline in net worth can lead to reduced financial flexibility and increased vulnerability to economic downturns.

The relationship between net worth and financial health is also influenced by **leverage**, or the use of debt to finance assets, as discussed by economists like **Modigliani and Miller** in their work on capital structure (1958). When debt levels are high, a small decline in asset values can lead to a significant decrease in net worth, while a low debt-to-equity ratio can provide a cushion against financial shocks.

## Key Components
- **Assets**: The value of assets, such as real estate, stocks, and bonds, directly affects net worth, and changes in asset values can have a significant impact on overall financial health.
- **Liabilities**: The level of liabilities, including debt and accounts payable, subtracts from assets to determine net worth, and high liability levels can increase financial risk.
- **Income**: The ability to generate income, through wages, investments, or business activities, is essential for maintaining and increasing net worth over time.
- **Expenses**: The level of expenses, including living expenses, taxes, and interest payments, can reduce net worth if not managed carefully.
- **Investments**: The returns on investments, such as stocks, bonds, and real estate, can contribute to increases in net worth over time.
- **Debt management**: The ability to manage debt levels and interest payments is critical to maintaining a healthy net worth, as excessive debt can lead to financial distress.

## Common Misconceptions
**Myth:** Net worth is only important for individuals and companies with high incomes — **Fact:** Net worth is a critical measure of financial health for all individuals and companies, regardless of income level, as it reflects the ability to weather financial shocks and achieve long-term financial goals.
**Myth:** Assets are always more valuable than liabilities — **Fact:** Liabilities, such as debt, can be beneficial if used to finance assets that generate returns, as described by **Fisher's debt-deflation theory** (1933).
**Myth:** Net worth is a static measure — **Fact:** Net worth can fluctuate over time due to changes in asset values, debt levels, and income, and regular monitoring is necessary to maintain financial health.
**Myth:** Only tangible assets contribute to net worth — **Fact:** Intangible assets, such as patents and copyrights, can be significant contributors to net worth, as seen in the high valuations of companies like Google and Amazon.

## In Practice
The net worth of a company like Walmart, with its large retail operations and significant assets, including its brand and distribution network, is a critical measure of its financial health. With annual revenues of over $500 billion (Walmart annual report) and a diverse portfolio of assets, Walmart's net worth is substantial, reflecting its ability to generate cash flow and invest in its core business. In contrast, a company like Sears, which has struggled with declining sales and high debt levels, has seen its net worth decline significantly, highlighting the importance of careful financial management and strategic investment.
