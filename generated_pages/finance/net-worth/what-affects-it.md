# What Affects Net Worth

Income is the single biggest factor affecting **net worth**, as it determines the amount of money available for saving and investing, which can increase net worth by tens of thousands of dollars over a lifetime, such as the case of a software engineer at Google earning a salary of $150,000 per year.

## Main Factors
- **Investment returns** — the earnings from investments, such as stocks or real estate, increase net worth, with a magnitude of 5-10% annual returns, as seen in the case of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, which has delivered an average annual return of 20% since its inception.
- **Savings rate** — the percentage of income saved, decreases net worth if too low, with a magnitude of 10-20% of income, as illustrated by the example of a household saving 10% of their $100,000 income, resulting in $10,000 in annual savings.
- **Debt** — the amount of money borrowed, decreases net worth, with a magnitude of 5-10% interest rates, as demonstrated by the case of a homeowner with a $200,000 mortgage at an interest rate of 6%, resulting in $12,000 in annual interest payments.
- **Inflation** — the rate at which prices increase, decreases net worth if not accounted for, with a magnitude of 2-3% annual inflation, as shown by the example of a retiree with a fixed income of $50,000 per year, whose purchasing power decreases by $1,000 due to 2% inflation.
- **Taxes** — the amount of money paid to the government, decreases net worth, with a magnitude of 20-30% of income, as seen in the case of a high-income earner paying 25% of their $500,000 income in taxes, resulting in $125,000 in annual tax payments.
- **Expenses** — the amount of money spent on necessities and luxuries, decreases net worth, with a magnitude of 50-70% of income, as illustrated by the example of a household with an annual income of $150,000, spending $90,000 on living expenses.
- **Inheritance** — the amount of money received from family or others, increases net worth, with a magnitude of tens of thousands to millions of dollars, as demonstrated by the case of a heir receiving a $1 million inheritance from a deceased relative.

## How They Interact
The interaction between **investment returns** and **savings rate** can amplify each other, as a high savings rate can provide more money to invest, which can generate higher returns, as seen in the case of a investor saving 20% of their income and earning an average annual return of 10% on their investments. On the other hand, **debt** and **expenses** can cancel each other out, as high expenses can lead to more debt, which can decrease net worth, as illustrated by the example of a household with high credit card debt and expenses, resulting in a decrease in net worth. Additionally, **inflation** and **taxes** can interact in a way that decreases net worth, as inflation can increase taxes, which can further decrease net worth, as demonstrated by the case of a taxpayer whose income increases due to inflation, resulting in a higher tax bracket.

## Controllable vs Uncontrollable
The controllable factors affecting net worth include **savings rate**, **investment returns**, **debt**, **expenses**, and **taxes**, which can be controlled by individuals through their financial decisions, such as creating a budget, investing in a diversified portfolio, and minimizing debt. For example, an individual can control their **savings rate** by allocating a fixed percentage of their income to savings, and can control their **investment returns** by selecting low-cost index funds. On the other hand, the uncontrollable factors include **inheritance** and **inflation**, which are outside of an individual's control. However, individuals can still take steps to mitigate the impact of these factors, such as by diversifying their investments to protect against inflation, and by creating a will to ensure that their inheritance is distributed according to their wishes.
