  "content": "Net worth is calculated by subtracting **liabilities** from **assets**, resulting in a financial snapshot of an individual's or organization's economic situation. This calculation is the core of the net worth mechanism, where inputs such as income, expenses, and investments are processed to produce an output of total wealth.\n\n## The Mechanism\nThe net worth mechanism involves a simple yet powerful equation: **Net Worth = Total Assets - Total Liabilities**. This equation is the foundation of personal finance and is used by individuals, businesses, and governments to assess their financial health.\n\n## Step-by-Step\n1. **Asset accumulation**: Individuals and organizations acquire assets such as cash, stocks, bonds, and real estate, which have a combined value of $100,000, for example. This process is driven by income, investments, and savings, resulting in a measurable increase in total assets.\n2. **Liability creation**: Simultaneously, liabilities such as loans, credit card debt, and mortgages are incurred, totaling $50,000, for instance. These liabilities are caused by expenses, debt, and financial obligations, leading to a measurable decrease in net worth.\n3. **Expense management**: Expenses such as rent, utilities, and groceries are subtracted from income, resulting in a net income of $40,000 per year, for example. Effective expense management causes a reduction in liabilities and an increase in assets.\n4. **Investment returns**: Investments such as stocks and bonds generate returns, such as a 7% annual return on a $10,000 investment in a **diversified portfolio**. These returns cause an increase in total assets and a subsequent increase in net worth.\n5. **Debt repayment**: Liabilities are reduced through debt repayment, such as paying off a $20,000 mortgage with a 4% interest rate over 10 years. This process causes a decrease in total liabilities and an increase in net worth.\n6. **Wealth accumulation**: The combination of asset accumulation, expense management, investment returns, and debt repayment results in a net worth of $150,000, for example, after 5 years of disciplined financial management.\n\n## Key Components\n- **Assets**: include cash, stocks, bonds, real estate, and other investments, which are the foundation of net worth.\n- **Liabilities**: include loans, credit card debt, mortgages, and other financial obligations, which reduce net worth.\n- **Income**: is the primary driver of asset accumulation and debt repayment, with an average annual income of $60,000 in the United States (US Census Bureau).\n- **Expenses**: include rent, utilities, groceries, and other living expenses, which reduce net income and increase liabilities.\n\n## Common Questions\nWhat happens if I fail to repay my debts? Failure to repay debts can lead to a decrease in credit score, resulting in higher interest rates and reduced access to credit, as seen in the **credit scoring model** developed by FICO.\nHow do investments affect my net worth? Investments such as stocks and bonds can generate returns, increasing total assets and net worth, as demonstrated by the **portfolio theory** of Harry Markowitz.\nWhat is the impact of expenses on my net worth? Expenses reduce net income, causing a decrease in asset accumulation and an increase in liabilities, as illustrated by the **life-cycle hypothesis** of Franco Modigliani.\nCan I increase my net worth by reducing my expenses? Yes, reducing expenses such as rent and utilities can increase net income, allowing for greater asset accumulation and debt repayment, as shown by the **permanent income hypothesis** of Milton Friedman.",
