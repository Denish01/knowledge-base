  "content": "Income stability is the most critical dependency for net worth, as it provides the foundation for saving and investing. \n## Key Dependencies\n- **Income stability** \u2014 without a stable income, individuals struggle to save and invest, leading to a decline in net worth, as seen in the case of the 2008 financial crisis where many people lost their jobs and subsequently defaulted on their mortgages.\n- **Expenses management** \u2014 effective management of expenses is crucial to allocating resources towards savings and investments, and failure to do so can lead to debt accumulation, as evidenced by the high credit card debt in the United States, with the average household carrying ~$15,000 in credit card debt (Federal Reserve).\n- **Investment knowledge** \u2014 a lack of understanding of investment options and strategies can result in poor investment decisions, such as the Enron scandal, where employees invested heavily in company stock, leading to significant financial losses.\n- **Risk management** \u2014 failure to manage risk can lead to significant losses, as seen in the case of Long-Term Capital Management, which collapsed in 1998 due to excessive leverage and unmanaged risk.\n- **Tax planning** \u2014 poor tax planning can result in unnecessary tax liabilities, reducing net worth, as illustrated by the case of Wesley Snipes, who owed ~$23 million in back taxes (IRS).\n- **Emergency funding** \u2014 insufficient emergency funds can lead to debt accumulation and reduced net worth, as seen in the case of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, where many individuals depleted their savings to cover living expenses.\n\n## Priority Order\nThe dependencies can be ranked in order of priority as follows:\n- **Income stability**, as it provides the foundation for all other dependencies\n- **Expenses management**, as it allows for the allocation of resources towards savings and investments\n- **Emergency funding**, as it provides a safety net in case of unexpected expenses or income loss\n- **Investment knowledge**, as it enables informed investment decisions\n- **Risk management**, as it helps to mitigate potential losses\n- **Tax planning**, as it reduces unnecessary tax liabilities\n\n## Common Gaps\nPeople often overlook the importance of **expenses management**, assuming that a high income is sufficient to guarantee a high net worth, but failure to manage expenses can lead to debt accumulation and reduced savings, as seen in the case of many lottery winners who have gone bankrupt despite their windfalls. Another common gap is the assumption that **investment knowledge** is only necessary for high-net-worth individuals, but in reality, it is essential for anyone looking to grow their wealth over time, and failure to educate oneself can result in poor investment decisions and significant losses.",
