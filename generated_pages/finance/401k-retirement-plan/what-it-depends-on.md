# What 401K Retirement Plan Depends On

Employee participation is contingent upon **clear communication of plan details**, as seen in the case of IBM, where a lack of transparency regarding plan changes led to a significant decline in employee participation and a subsequent lawsuit.

## Key Dependencies
- **Employer matching contributions** — the absence of which can lead to low employee participation, as employees may not see the value in contributing to a plan without some form of employer match, a problem faced by companies like Boeing, where low match rates have been linked to lower participation rates.
- **Investment options** — a limited range of investment options can lead to a lack of diversification, increasing the risk of significant losses, as seen in the case of Enron, where employees were heavily invested in company stock, resulting in significant financial losses when the company failed.
- **Vesting schedules** — a poorly designed vesting schedule can lead to high employee turnover, as employees may leave the company before they are fully vested in their retirement benefits, a problem faced by companies like Google, where high turnover rates have been linked to generous vesting schedules.
- **Fees and expenses** — high fees and expenses can erode the value of retirement savings over time, as seen in the case of Wal-Mart, where employees sued the company over excessive fees in their 401(k) plan.
- **Compliance with regulatory requirements** — failure to comply with regulatory requirements, such as those outlined in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), can result in significant fines and penalties, as seen in the case of Lockheed Martin, where the company paid millions in fines for non-compliance.
- **Recordkeeping and administration** — inadequate recordkeeping and administration can lead to errors and discrepancies in employee accounts, as seen in the case of General Motors, where a recordkeeping error resulted in overpayments to some employees and underpayments to others.

## Priority Order
The dependencies can be ranked in order of priority as follows:
- **Clear communication of plan details**, as it is essential for employee participation and understanding of the plan.
- **Compliance with regulatory requirements**, as non-compliance can result in significant fines and penalties.
- **Employer matching contributions**, as they are a key factor in encouraging employee participation.
- **Investment options**, as a limited range of options can increase the risk of significant losses.
- **Fees and expenses**, as high fees can erode the value of retirement savings over time.
- **Vesting schedules**, as a poorly designed schedule can lead to high employee turnover, but is less critical than the other dependencies.

## Common Gaps
Many companies overlook the importance of **regular plan reviews** and **fee benchmarking**, assuming that their plan is competitive and compliant with regulatory requirements, but failure to do so can result in excessive fees and non-compliance, as seen in the case of General Electric, where the company paid millions in fines for non-compliance.
