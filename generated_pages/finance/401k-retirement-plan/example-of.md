# Example of 401K Retirement Plan

## Definition
A 401K retirement plan is a type of **defined contribution plan** established by Congress in 1978 as part of the Revenue Act, allowing employees to contribute a portion of their salary to a tax-deferred retirement account.

## How It Works
The 401K plan operates on the principle of employee contributions, which are made before taxes, reducing the employee's taxable income for the year. For example, if an employee earns $50,000 per year and contributes $5,000 to their 401K, their taxable income would be reduced to $45,000. The funds in the 401K account are then invested in a variety of assets, such as stocks, bonds, and mutual funds, with the goal of growing the account balance over time. According to **Ricardo's law of diminishing returns**, as the account balance grows, the rate of return may decrease, emphasizing the need for diversification and regular portfolio rebalancing.

The 401K plan also allows employers to make matching contributions to their employees' accounts, providing an additional incentive for employees to participate in the plan. The **Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA)** of 1974 regulates 401K plans, requiring employers to provide certain disclosures and protections to plan participants. For instance, ERISA requires plan administrators to provide participants with a summary plan description, which outlines the plan's terms and conditions, including eligibility, benefits, and voting rights. The **Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)** also regulates 401K plans, requiring plan administrators to register the plan and provide regular financial statements.

The investment options available in a 401K plan can have a significant impact on the plan's performance. For example, a plan that offers a range of low-cost index funds may provide better returns than a plan that offers only high-cost actively managed funds. According to a study by **Vanguard**, the average expense ratio for index funds is 0.05%, compared to 0.5% for actively managed funds. This can result in significant cost savings for plan participants over time.

## Key Components
- **Employee contributions**: The amount contributed by the employee to their 401K account, which reduces their taxable income for the year and is invested in a variety of assets, such as stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.
- **Employer matching contributions**: The amount contributed by the employer to the employee's 401K account, which provides an additional incentive for employees to participate in the plan and can increase the overall account balance.
- **Investment options**: The range of assets available for investment in the 401K plan, such as stocks, bonds, and mutual funds, which can affect the plan's performance and returns.
- **Vesting schedule**: The schedule according to which employer contributions become fully owned by the employee, which can affect the employee's decision to leave the company or retire.
- **Loan provisions**: The rules and regulations governing loans from the 401K account, which can provide employees with access to cash in emergency situations but may also reduce the account balance and potentially trigger taxes and penalties.
- **Withdrawal rules**: The rules and regulations governing withdrawals from the 401K account, such as the age at which withdrawals can be made without penalty and the required minimum distributions, which can affect the employee's retirement income and tax liability.

## Common Misconceptions
**Myth:** 401K plans are only available to large corporations — **Fact:** 401K plans are available to companies of all sizes, with some plans designed specifically for small businesses and sole proprietors.
**Myth:** 401K plans are too complicated and expensive to administer — **Fact:** Many 401K plan providers offer simplified administration and low-cost investment options, making it easier and more affordable for companies to offer a 401K plan to their employees.
**Myth:** 401K plans are not a good option for employees who change jobs frequently — **Fact:** 401K plans are portable, meaning that employees can take their account balance with them when they change jobs, and many plans offer flexible withdrawal options.
**Myth:** 401K plans are not a good option for employees who are close to retirement — **Fact:** 401K plans can provide a tax-deferred source of retirement income, and many plans offer income options, such as annuities, that can provide a guaranteed income stream in retirement.

## In Practice
The **IBM 401K Plus Plan** is an example of a 401K plan in practice. The plan allows employees to contribute up to 15% of their salary to their 401K account, with IBM matching 5% of the employee's contribution. The plan offers a range of investment options, including low-cost index funds and target date funds, and provides employees with online access to their account balances and investment options. According to **IBM's annual report**, the company contributed $1.3 billion to its employees' 401K accounts in 2020, and the plan has over $50 billion in assets. The plan also offers loan provisions and withdrawal rules, such as the ability to borrow up to 50% of the account balance and required minimum distributions starting at age 72.
