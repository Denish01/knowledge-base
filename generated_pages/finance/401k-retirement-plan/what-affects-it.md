# What Affects 401K Retirement Plan

Employee contribution rates are the single biggest factor affecting 401k retirement plan outcomes, as they directly impact the total amount saved and invested over time. 
The **Employee Contribution Rate** increases the total 401k balance, with a higher rate resulting in a larger balance, for example, an employee contributing 10% of their $50,000 annual salary would save $5,000 per year, whereas contributing 15% would save $7,500 per year. 
The **Employer Matching Rate** also increases the total 401k balance, with a higher rate resulting in a larger employer contribution, for instance, an employer matching 50% of employee contributions up to 6% of their salary would contribute $1,500 per year to an employee earning $50,000 and contributing 6% of their salary. 
The **Investment Return Rate** affects the 401k balance, with a higher rate resulting in faster growth, such as an investment portfolio earning an average annual return of 7% would grow a $10,000 initial investment to $14,000 in 5 years, whereas a 4% return would only grow it to $12,000. 
The **Fee Rate** decreases the 401k balance, with a higher rate resulting in lower returns, for example, a 1% annual management fee on a $10,000 investment would reduce the balance by $100 per year. 
The **Inflation Rate** affects the 401k balance, with a higher rate resulting in lower purchasing power, such as an inflation rate of 3% would reduce the purchasing power of a $10,000 investment to $9,700 in one year. 
The **Time Horizon** affects the 401k balance, with a longer horizon resulting in more time for investments to grow, for instance, an employee starting to contribute to their 401k at age 25, rather than 35, would have an additional 10 years for their investments to compound.

## Main Factors
- **Employee Contribution Rate** — increases the total 401k balance, with a higher rate resulting in a larger balance, for example, an employee contributing 10% of their $50,000 annual salary would save $5,000 per year, whereas contributing 15% would save $7,500 per year.
- **Employer Matching Rate** — increases the total 401k balance, with a higher rate resulting in a larger employer contribution, for instance, an employer matching 50% of employee contributions up to 6% of their salary would contribute $1,500 per year to an employee earning $50,000 and contributing 6% of their salary.
- **Investment Return Rate** — affects the 401k balance, with a higher rate resulting in faster growth, such as an investment portfolio earning an average annual return of 7% would grow a $10,000 initial investment to $14,000 in 5 years, whereas a 4% return would only grow it to $12,000.
- **Fee Rate** — decreases the 401k balance, with a higher rate resulting in lower returns, for example, a 1% annual management fee on a $10,000 investment would reduce the balance by $100 per year.
- **Inflation Rate** — affects the 401k balance, with a higher rate resulting in lower purchasing power, such as an inflation rate of 3% would reduce the purchasing power of a $10,000 investment to $9,700 in one year.
- **Time Horizon** — affects the 401k balance, with a longer horizon resulting in more time for investments to grow, for instance, an employee starting to contribute to their 401k at age 25, rather than 35, would have an additional 10 years for their investments to compound.
- **Portfolio Allocation** — affects the 401k balance, with a more aggressive allocation resulting in higher potential returns, but also higher potential losses, such as allocating 70% of the portfolio to stocks and 30% to bonds would result in higher potential returns, but also higher potential losses, compared to a more conservative allocation of 40% stocks and 60% bonds.

## How They Interact
The interaction between **Employee Contribution Rate** and **Employer Matching Rate** amplifies the total 401k balance, as a higher employee contribution rate can result in a larger employer match, for example, an employee contributing 10% of their $50,000 annual salary and receiving a 50% employer match would receive a $2,500 employer contribution, whereas contributing 6% would only receive a $1,500 employer contribution. 
The interaction between **Investment Return Rate** and **Time Horizon** also amplifies the total 401k balance, as a longer time horizon allows for more time for investments to compound, such as an investment portfolio earning an average annual return of 7% would grow a $10,000 initial investment to $38,000 in 20 years, whereas a 4% return would only grow it to $21,000. 
The interaction between **Fee Rate** and **Investment Return Rate** cancels each other out, as a higher investment return rate can offset the effect of a higher fee rate, for example, an investment portfolio earning an average annual return of 8% with a 1% annual management fee would still result in a net return of 7%, which is higher than a portfolio earning an average annual return of 5% with a 0.5% annual management fee.

## Controllable vs Uncontrollable
The controllable factors are **Employee Contribution Rate**, **Portfolio Allocation**, and **Fee Rate**, as employees can control how much they contribute to their 401k, how their portfolio is allocated, and which investment options they choose, which can affect the fee rate. 
The uncontrollable factors are **Employer Matching Rate**, **Investment Return Rate**, **Inflation Rate**, and **Time Horizon**, as employees have limited control over these factors, although they can try to negotiate with their employer for a higher matching rate or choose investment options that are less affected by inflation. 
Employees can control their **Employee Contribution Rate** by adjusting their contribution amount, and employers can control the **Employer Matching Rate** by adjusting their matching policy. 
Investment managers can control the **Fee Rate** by adjusting their management fees, and employees can control their **Portfolio Allocation** by choosing different investment options.
