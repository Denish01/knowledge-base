  "content": "There are four main categories of 401K retirement plans, organized by their funding and management structures. \n## Main Categories\n- **Traditional 401K** \u2014 a tax-deferred plan where employees contribute pre-tax dollars, reducing their taxable income, and the employer may match contributions, as seen in **IBM's** traditional 401K plan, which offers a 6% company match.\n- **Safe Harbor 401K** \u2014 a type of plan that requires the employer to make mandatory contributions to employees' accounts, either through a match or a non-elective contribution, such as **Microsoft's** safe harbor 401K plan, which provides a 4% non-elective contribution.\n- **Solo 401K** \u2014 a plan designed for self-employed individuals or small business owners with no employees, allowing them to make tax-deductible contributions as both the employer and employee, as used by **Warren Buffett's** solo 401K plan for his solo business ventures.\n- **Roth 401K** \u2014 a plan where employees contribute after-tax dollars, and the funds grow tax-free, with **Walmart's** Roth 401K plan offering employees the option to contribute to a Roth account.\n\n## Comparison Table\n| Category | Funding Structure | Employer Contribution Requirement | Investment Options |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Traditional 401K | Employee pre-tax contributions, optional employer match | No requirement | Typically a range of mutual funds and target-date funds |\n| Safe Harbor 401K | Employee pre-tax contributions, mandatory employer contributions | Employer must contribute 3% or 4% of employee compensation | Similar to traditional 401K |\n| Solo 401K | Self-employed individual or small business owner contributions | No requirement, but can make deductible contributions as employer | Often includes a range of investment options, including real estate and cryptocurrencies |\n| Roth 401K | Employee after-tax contributions | No requirement | Similar to traditional 401K, with possible inclusion of Roth-specific investment options |\n\n## How They Relate\nThe categories often overlap, as employers may offer multiple types of 401K plans, such as a traditional 401K and a Roth 401K. For example, **Google's** 401K plan offers both traditional and Roth options, allowing employees to choose which type of account to contribute to. The **Solo 401K** and **Traditional 401K** plans are commonly confused, as both offer tax-deferred growth, but the solo 401K is designed specifically for self-employed individuals or small business owners. In contrast, **Safe Harbor 401K** and **Traditional 401K** plans are distinct due to the mandatory employer contribution requirement in safe harbor plans, which can reduce the administrative burden for employers, as seen in **Apple's** safe harbor 401K plan.",
