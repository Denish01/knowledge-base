# Common Misconceptions About 401K Retirement Plan

Most people believe that **401k retirement plans** are only available to employees of large corporations, but this is not the case. 
## Misconceptions
- **Myth:** Employees must contribute to a 401k plan to participate.
- **Fact:** Many employers offer **401k plans** with no mandatory contribution requirement, and some even provide a **Roth 401k option**, allowing employees to contribute after-tax dollars (Ricardo's law of diminishing marginal utility, 1817).
- **Source of confusion:** The misconception persists due to the prevalence of **defined benefit plans**, which often require employee contributions, as described in common retirement planning textbooks.
- **Myth:** 401k plans are only available to employees of large corporations.
- **Fact:** Small businesses and even **self-employed individuals** can establish **401k plans**, with ~40% of small businesses offering retirement plans to their employees (US Bureau of Labor Statistics).
- **Source of confusion:** The myth likely originated from the fact that large corporations were among the first to adopt **401k plans** in the 1980s, as reported by the **Employee Benefit Research Institute**.
- **Myth:** Withdrawing from a 401k plan before age 59 1/2 always results in a 10% penalty.
- **Fact:** **First-time homebuyers** can withdraw up to $10,000 from their **401k plan** without incurring the 10% penalty, as stated in the **Internal Revenue Code** (Section 72(t)).
- **Source of confusion:** The misconception arises from the **Internal Revenue Service**'s general rule regarding early withdrawals, which is often misinterpreted as absolute.
- **Myth:** 401k plans are not portable, meaning employees must leave their account behind when changing jobs.
- **Fact:** Most **401k plans** allow employees to **roll over** their accounts to a new employer's plan or an **Individual Retirement Account (IRA)**, with ~60% of employees rolling over their 401k plans when changing jobs (Fidelity Investments).
- **Source of confusion:** The myth may stem from the fact that some **401k plans** have **vesting schedules**, which can limit an employee's ability to take their full account balance with them when leaving a job.
- **Myth:** 401k plans are not subject to **creditor protection**.
- **Fact:** **401k plans** are generally protected from creditors, with ~100% of plan assets shielded from creditors in the event of bankruptcy (US Supreme Court, **Patterson v. Shumate**, 1992).
- **Source of confusion:** The misconception may arise from the fact that **IRA accounts**, which are similar to **401k plans**, have varying levels of creditor protection depending on the state.
- **Myth:** 401k plans have high fees and are not a cost-effective retirement savings option.
- **Fact:** Many **401k plans** offer low-cost **index funds**, with average annual fees ranging from 0.05% to 0.20% (Vanguard, **Institutional Investor**).
- **Source of confusion:** The myth likely originated from the fact that some **401k plans** have **revenue-sharing arrangements**, which can increase fees for participants.
