  "content": "## Definition\nA 401K retirement plan is a type of **defined contribution pension account** established by Ted Benna in 1980, which allows employees to contribute a portion of their salary to a tax-deferred investment account.\n\n## How It Works\nThe 401K plan operates by allowing employees to contribute a percentage of their salary to the account on a pre-tax basis, reducing their taxable income. The employer may also offer to match a portion of the employee's contribution, typically up to a certain percentage. For example, a company like **IBM** may match 50% of the employee's contribution up to 6% of their salary. The funds in the 401K account are then invested in a variety of assets, such as stocks, bonds, or mutual funds, and the returns on these investments are tax-deferred until withdrawal.\n\nThe **Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA)** provides the regulatory framework for 401K plans, requiring employers to adhere to certain guidelines and disclosure requirements. The plan administrator, often a financial institution like **Fidelity**, is responsible for managing the day-to-day operations of the plan, including processing contributions, investments, and distributions. The **Internal Revenue Service (IRS)** sets annual contribution limits, which for 2022 are $19,500 for employees under age 50 and $26,000 for employees 50 and older (IRS Publication 590-A).\n\nThe investment options available in a 401K plan can vary widely depending on the plan sponsor and the plan administrator. Some plans may offer a range of **index funds**, which track a specific market index like the **S&P 500**, while others may offer **actively managed funds**, which attempt to beat the market through individual stock selection. The **SEC's Investment Company Act of 1940** provides regulatory oversight of these investment options, ensuring that they operate in a fair and transparent manner.\n\n## Key Components\n- **Employee contributions**: The amount contributed by the employee, which reduces their taxable income and is invested in the plan.\n- **Employer matching**: The amount contributed by the employer, which is often based on a percentage of the employee's contribution.\n- **Investment options**: The range of assets available for investment, such as stocks, bonds, or mutual funds.\n- **Vesting schedule**: The timeframe over which the employer's contributions become fully owned by the employee, which can range from immediate vesting to a multi-year schedule.\n- **Loan provisions**: The ability for employees to borrow from their 401K account, typically with a maximum loan amount and repayment terms.\n- **Withdrawal rules**: The regulations governing when and how employees can withdraw funds from their 401K account, including any penalties for early withdrawal.\n\n## Common Misconceptions\n**Myth:** 401K plans are only available to large corporations \u2014 **Fact:** Small businesses can also establish 401K plans, with **ADP** and **Paychex** offering plan administration services tailored to small businesses.\n**Myth:** 401K plans are too complex for individual investors \u2014 **Fact:** Many plan administrators, such as **Vanguard**, offer online tools and resources to help employees manage their accounts and make informed investment decisions.\n**Myth:** 401K plans are not portable if you change jobs \u2014 **Fact:** While some plans may have vesting schedules or loan provisions that can make it difficult to take your account with you, many plans allow employees to roll over their accounts to a new employer's plan or an **IRA**.\n\n## In Practice\nA company like **Microsoft** may offer a 401K plan to its employees, with a 50% match on contributions up to 6% of salary. If an employee contributes $10,000 to their 401K account in a given year, Microsoft would contribute an additional $3,000. The employee's account would then be invested in a range of assets, such as **Dodge & Cox** mutual funds, and the returns on these investments would be tax-deferred until withdrawal. If the employee were to leave Microsoft and join **Google**, they could roll over their 401K account to Google's plan or an **IRA**, maintaining control over their retirement savings.",
