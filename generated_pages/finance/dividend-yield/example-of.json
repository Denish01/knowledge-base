  "content": "## Definition\nDividend yield is the ratio of the annual dividend payment per share to the stock's current price per share, calculated as **dividend per share** divided by **price per share**.\n\n## How It Works\nThe dividend yield is a measure of the return on investment for a stock, indicating the amount of cash flow an investor can expect to receive relative to the stock's current price. For example, if a company pays an annual dividend of $2 per share and the current stock price is $50 per share, the dividend yield would be 4% ($2 / $50). This calculation is based on the **Gordon growth model**, which assumes that the dividend payment will grow at a constant rate. According to **Graham and Dodd's** investment principles, a high dividend yield can be attractive to income-seeking investors, but it may also indicate a higher risk of dividend cuts or a declining stock price.\n\nThe dividend yield is influenced by the **payout ratio**, which is the proportion of earnings paid out as dividends. A high payout ratio may indicate that a company is returning a large portion of its earnings to shareholders, but it may also limit the company's ability to invest in growth opportunities. For instance, **Johnson & Johnson** has a payout ratio of around 50%, indicating that it returns half of its earnings to shareholders as dividends. In contrast, **Amazon** has a payout ratio of 0%, as it reinvests all of its earnings in the business.\n\nThe dividend yield can also be affected by **interest rates**, as higher interest rates can make bonds and other fixed-income investments more attractive to investors, leading to a decrease in stock prices and an increase in dividend yields. For example, when the **Federal Reserve** raises interest rates, it can lead to a decrease in stock prices, which in turn can increase the dividend yield. This is because investors may become more risk-averse and seek higher returns from fixed-income investments, causing them to sell stocks and buy bonds.\n\n## Key Components\n- **Dividend per share**: the amount of cash paid out to shareholders per share, which directly affects the dividend yield. An increase in dividend per share will increase the dividend yield, while a decrease will decrease it.\n- **Price per share**: the current market price of the stock, which is used to calculate the dividend yield. A decrease in price per share will increase the dividend yield, while an increase will decrease it.\n- **Payout ratio**: the proportion of earnings paid out as dividends, which influences the dividend yield. A high payout ratio may indicate a higher dividend yield, but it may also limit the company's ability to invest in growth opportunities.\n- **Interest rates**: the level of interest rates in the economy, which can affect the attractiveness of stocks relative to bonds and other fixed-income investments. Higher interest rates can lead to a decrease in stock prices and an increase in dividend yields.\n- **Earnings per share**: the company's profitability, which is used to calculate the payout ratio and dividend yield. An increase in earnings per share can lead to an increase in dividend per share, which in turn can increase the dividend yield.\n- **Dividend growth rate**: the rate at which the dividend payment is expected to grow, which can affect the dividend yield. A high dividend growth rate can lead to a higher dividend yield, as investors expect higher future dividend payments.\n\n## Common Misconceptions\n- **Myth:** A high dividend yield always indicates a good investment opportunity. **Fact:** A high dividend yield can also indicate a higher risk of dividend cuts or a declining stock price, as seen in the case of **General Motors**, which had a high dividend yield before filing for bankruptcy in 2009.\n- **Myth:** Dividend yield is the only factor to consider when evaluating a stock. **Fact:** Other factors, such as **return on equity** (ROE) and **price-to-earnings ratio** (P/E), should also be considered, as seen in the case of **Warren Buffett's** investment strategy, which emphasizes the importance of ROE and P/E.\n- **Myth:** Dividend yield is only relevant for income-seeking investors. **Fact:** Dividend yield can also be an important factor for growth investors, as it can indicate the company's ability to generate cash flow and invest in growth opportunities, as seen in the case of **Microsoft**, which has a dividend yield of around 1% but has consistently increased its dividend payment over the years.\n- **Myth:** Dividend yield is not affected by interest rates. **Fact:** Interest rates can have a significant impact on dividend yield, as seen in the case of the **2008 financial crisis**, when interest rates were cut to near zero, leading to a decrease in bond yields and an increase in stock prices, which in turn decreased dividend yields.\n\n## In Practice\nConsider the case of **Coca-Cola**, which has a dividend yield of around 3% and a payout ratio of around 70%. If the company increases its dividend payment by 10%, the dividend yield will increase to around 3.3%, assuming the stock price remains constant. However, if the stock price increases by 10%, the dividend yield will decrease to around 2.7%, assuming the dividend payment remains constant. This example illustrates the importance of considering both the dividend yield and the stock price when evaluating a stock, as well as the impact of interest rates and other market factors on the dividend yield. According to **Morningstar**, Coca-Cola has a **dividend coverage ratio** of around 1.5, indicating that the company has a stable dividend payment and can afford to increase its dividend payment in the future.",
