  "content": "There are four primary categories of dividend yield, organized by their calculation methods and investor perspectives: **Dividend Yield on Cost**, **Trailing Dividend Yield**, **Forward Dividend Yield**, and **Indicated Dividend Yield**.\n\n## Main Categories\n- **Dividend Yield on Cost** \u2014 calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the investor's initial purchase price, providing insight into the return on investment for the shareholder, as seen in the case of **Coca-Cola**, which has consistently paid dividends to its shareholders.\n- **Trailing Dividend Yield** \u2014 determined by dividing the total dividend payments made over the past 12 months by the current stock price, offering a snapshot of the company's recent dividend performance, such as **Johnson & Johnson**, which has a history of stable dividend payments.\n- **Forward Dividend Yield** \u2014 estimated by dividing the projected annual dividend payment by the current stock price, giving investors an idea of the potential future return, as with **Procter & Gamble**, which has a strong track record of increasing its dividend payout.\n- **Indicated Dividend Yield** \u2014 calculated by dividing the most recent quarterly dividend payment, annualized, by the current stock price, providing a timely indicator of a company's dividend yield, as exemplified by **3M**, which regularly reviews and adjusts its dividend payout.\n\n## Comparison Table\n| Category | Calculation Method | Investor Perspective | Risk Level |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Dividend Yield on Cost** | Annual dividend / Initial purchase price | Long-term investment | Low |\n| **Trailing Dividend Yield** | Total dividend payments over 12 months / Current stock price | Recent performance | Medium |\n| **Forward Dividend Yield** | Projected annual dividend / Current stock price | Future potential | High |\n| **Indicated Dividend Yield** | Most recent quarterly dividend, annualized / Current stock price | Timely indicator | Medium |\n\n## How They Relate\nThe categories of dividend yield often overlap or are commonly confused, particularly between **Trailing Dividend Yield** and **Indicated Dividend Yield**, as both provide a snapshot of a company's recent dividend performance, but differ in their calculation methods. **Forward Dividend Yield** and **Dividend Yield on Cost** are also related, as the forward yield can influence an investor's decision to purchase a stock, thereby affecting their yield on cost. Additionally, **Indicated Dividend Yield** can be used as a proxy for **Forward Dividend Yield** when forward estimates are not available, but this may not always accurately reflect the company's future dividend payments, as seen in the case of **General Electric**, which has adjusted its dividend payout in response to changing market conditions.",
