# What is Examples Of Dividend Yield?

1. INTRODUCTION
Dividend yield is a measure of the return on investment for a stock, calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stock's current price. It represents the ratio of the dividend paid per share to the stock's current price per share. This metric is crucial for investors as it helps them evaluate the potential income they can earn from their investments. Understanding dividend yield is essential for making informed investment decisions.

2. EVERYDAY EXAMPLES
Consider a few everyday examples to illustrate the concept of dividend yield. For instance, suppose you own 100 shares of XYZ Corporation, a local utility company, which pays an annual dividend of $2 per share. If the current market price of XYZ Corporation is $50 per share, the dividend yield would be 4% ($2 dividend per share / $50 current price per share). Another example could be a small investor who buys 50 shares of a real estate investment trust (REIT) for $20 per share, with an annual dividend of $1 per share, resulting in a dividend yield of 5% ($1 dividend per share / $20 current price per share). Additionally, imagine a retiree who invests in a dividend-paying mutual fund with a current price of $30 per share and an annual dividend of $1.50 per share, giving a dividend yield of 5% ($1.50 dividend per share / $30 current price per share). Lastly, a young investor might purchase 200 shares of a telecommunications company for $15 per share, with an annual dividend of $0.60 per share, leading to a dividend yield of 4% ($0.60 dividend per share / $15 current price per share).

3. NOTABLE EXAMPLES
Well-known companies often provide notable examples of dividend yield. For example, Johnson & Johnson, a multinational healthcare company, has a history of paying consistent dividends. If an investor buys 100 shares of Johnson & Johnson at $100 per share with an annual dividend of $3.80 per share, the dividend yield would be 3.8% ($3.80 dividend per share / $100 current price per share). Another example is Coca-Cola, a beverage company that has paid dividends for many years. Assuming an investor purchases 50 shares of Coca-Cola at $60 per share with an annual dividend of $1.60 per share, the dividend yield would be 2.67% ($1.60 dividend per share / $60 current price per share).

4. EDGE CASES
There are also some unusual examples of dividend yield. For instance, a company like Realty Income, a REIT that focuses on commercial properties, has a history of paying monthly dividends. If an investor buys 100 shares of Realty Income at $70 per share with an annual dividend of $2.79 per share, the dividend yield would be 3.99% ($2.79 dividend per share / $70 current price per share). Another edge case could be a master limited partnership (MLP) like Magellan Midstream Partners, which pays a high dividend yield due to its business structure. Assuming an investor purchases 50 shares of Magellan Midstream Partners at $50 per share with an annual dividend of $4.00 per share, the dividend yield would be 8% ($4.00 dividend per share / $50 current price per share).

5. NON-EXAMPLES
Some people might confuse other financial metrics with dividend yield. For example, the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio) is not the same as dividend yield, as it compares the current stock price to the company's earnings per share. Another non-example is the interest rate on a savings account, which is a fixed rate and does not take into account the potential risks and rewards associated with investing in stocks. Additionally, the capital appreciation of a stock, which is the increase in the stock's value over time, is not the same as dividend yield, as it does not provide regular income to the investor.

6. PATTERN
All valid examples of dividend yield have one thing in common: they involve the ratio of the annual dividend payment to the current stock price. Whether it's a well-known company or a small investor, the calculation of dividend yield remains the same. The key elements are the dividend per share and the current price per share, which are used to determine the return on investment. By understanding this pattern, investors can evaluate different investment opportunities and make informed decisions about their portfolios.
