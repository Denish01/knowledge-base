# What Is Dividend Yield?

## Definition
Dividend yield is the ratio of the annual dividend payment per share to the stock's current price per share, a concept rooted in **Benjamin Graham's** investment principles.

## How It Works
The dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment per share by the current stock price. For instance, if a company pays an annual dividend of $5 per share and the current stock price is $100, the dividend yield would be 5%. This metric is crucial for investors seeking regular income from their investments, as it indicates the return on investment in the form of dividends. The dividend yield is also a key component of the **Gordon Growth Model**, which estimates the intrinsic value of a stock based on its dividend payments and expected growth rate.

The dividend yield is influenced by the company's **payout ratio**, which is the proportion of earnings paid out as dividends. A higher payout ratio typically results in a higher dividend yield, but it may also indicate that the company is retaining less of its earnings for reinvestment and growth. For example, **Johnson & Johnson** has a long history of paying consistent dividends, with a payout ratio of around 50% (Johnson & Johnson annual report). This has contributed to its attractive dividend yield, making it a popular choice among income-seeking investors.

The dividend yield can also be affected by changes in the stock price. When the stock price falls, the dividend yield increases, making the stock more attractive to income investors. Conversely, when the stock price rises, the dividend yield decreases, making the stock less attractive to income investors. This relationship is evident in the **Dow Jones Industrial Average**, which has historically offered a higher dividend yield during periods of market volatility, such as the 2008 financial crisis, when the index's dividend yield increased to around 4.5% (Dow Jones Industrial Average historical data).

## Key Components
- **Dividend per share**: the amount of dividend paid per share, which directly affects the dividend yield and is often influenced by the company's **earnings per share**.
- **Stock price**: the current market price of the stock, which inversely affects the dividend yield and can be influenced by market sentiment and **economic indicators** such as GDP growth.
- **Payout ratio**: the proportion of earnings paid out as dividends, which affects the dividend yield and is often influenced by the company's **retention ratio** and growth strategy.
- **Growth rate**: the expected rate of growth in dividend payments, which affects the dividend yield and is often influenced by the company's **reinvestment rate** and industry trends.
- **Risk profile**: the level of risk associated with the investment, which affects the dividend yield and is often influenced by the company's **debt-to-equity ratio** and **credit rating**.
- **Market conditions**: the overall state of the market, which can affect the dividend yield and is often influenced by **monetary policy** and **fiscal policy** decisions.

## Common Misconceptions
**Myth:** High dividend yields are always a sign of a healthy company — **Fact:** A high dividend yield can also indicate a distressed company with a low stock price, such as **General Motors** in 2008, which had a dividend yield of over 10% before filing for bankruptcy (General Motors bankruptcy filing).
**Myth:** Dividend yields are only relevant for income investors — **Fact:** Dividend yields can also be an important consideration for growth investors, as they can indicate a company's ability to generate cash and reinvest in its business, such as **Microsoft**, which has increased its dividend payout by over 10% annually in recent years (Microsoft annual report).
**Myth:** Dividend yields are fixed and unchanging — **Fact:** Dividend yields can fluctuate over time due to changes in the stock price, dividend payments, and market conditions, such as the **S&P 500**, which has seen its dividend yield range from 1.5% to 4.5% over the past decade (S&P 500 historical data).
**Myth:** All high-dividend-yield stocks are risky — **Fact:** Some high-dividend-yield stocks, such as **Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)**, can offer relatively stable income streams and lower risk profiles, such as **Realty Income**, which has a dividend yield of over 4% and a **credit rating** of A- (Realty Income annual report).

## In Practice
Consider the case of **Coca-Cola**, which has a long history of paying consistent dividends and currently offers a dividend yield of around 3.5% (Coca-Cola annual report). With a payout ratio of around 70%, the company has demonstrated its commitment to returning value to shareholders through dividends (Coca-Cola annual report). Assuming an investor purchases $10,000 worth of Coca-Cola stock, they can expect to receive around $350 in annual dividend payments, providing a relatively stable source of income. As the company continues to grow and expand its operations, the dividend yield may fluctuate, but the investor can benefit from the potential long-term growth in dividend payments and stock price.
