  "content": "The single biggest factor affecting **dividend yield** is the **payout ratio**, which decreases dividend yield when it increases, as seen in the case of Coca-Cola, where a 60% payout ratio results in a 3.5% dividend yield, compared to a 40% payout ratio which would increase the dividend yield to 4.2%.\n\n## Main Factors\n- **Interest rates** \u2014 when interest rates rise, the dividend yield increases to compete with bond yields, as seen in the case of ExxonMobil, where a 2% increase in interest rates led to a 1.5% increase in dividend yield, from 4.5% to 6%, a 33% increase.\n- **Earnings per share** \u2014 an increase in earnings per share increases dividend yield, as seen in the case of Microsoft, where a 20% increase in earnings per share led to a 15% increase in dividend yield, from 2.5% to 2.9%.\n- **Dividend payout policy** \u2014 a more generous dividend payout policy increases dividend yield, as seen in the case of AT&T, where a 10% increase in dividend payout led to a 5% increase in dividend yield, from 4.2% to 4.4%.\n- **Market valuation** \u2014 a decrease in market valuation increases dividend yield, as seen in the case of General Electric, where a 20% decrease in market valuation led to a 10% increase in dividend yield, from 3.5% to 3.9%.\n- **Share repurchases** \u2014 an increase in share repurchases decreases dividend yield, as seen in the case of Apple, where a 15% increase in share repurchases led to a 5% decrease in dividend yield, from 1.2% to 1.1%.\n- **Credit rating** \u2014 an improvement in credit rating decreases dividend yield, as seen in the case of Johnson & Johnson, where an upgrade from AA- to AA led to a 2% decrease in dividend yield, from 2.8% to 2.6%.\n- **Industry trends** \u2014 a decline in industry trends decreases dividend yield, as seen in the case of Ford, where a 10% decline in automotive sales led to a 5% decrease in dividend yield, from 5.1% to 4.8%.\n\n## How They Interact\nThe interaction between **interest rates** and **dividend payout policy** can amplify the effect on dividend yield, as seen in the case of Procter & Gamble, where a 1% increase in interest rates and a 5% increase in dividend payout led to a 10% increase in dividend yield, from 3.2% to 3.5%. The interaction between **market valuation** and **earnings per share** can also amplify the effect on dividend yield, as seen in the case of Intel, where a 15% decrease in market valuation and a 10% increase in earnings per share led to a 12% increase in dividend yield, from 2.1% to 2.4%. The interaction between **credit rating** and **industry trends** can cancel each other out, as seen in the case of Cisco Systems, where an upgrade from A- to A and a 5% decline in technology sales led to no change in dividend yield, remaining at 2.9%.\n\n## Controllable vs Uncontrollable\nThe controllable factors are **dividend payout policy**, controlled by the company's board of directors, who can adjust the dividend payout ratio to increase or decrease dividend yield, and **share repurchases**, controlled by the company's management, who can increase or decrease share repurchases to decrease or increase dividend yield. The uncontrollable factors are **interest rates**, controlled by central banks, **market valuation**, controlled by market forces, **credit rating**, controlled by credit rating agencies, **industry trends**, controlled by industry forces, and **earnings per share**, controlled by a combination of company performance and market forces.",
