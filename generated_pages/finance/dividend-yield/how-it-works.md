# How Dividend Yield Works

Dividend yield is a **financial metric** that measures the ratio of annual dividend payments to the stock's current price, causing investors to reevaluate their investment decisions based on the expected return.

## The Mechanism
The core cause-and-effect chain of dividend yield involves the **dividend per share**, which is the amount of money distributed to each shareholder, and the **stock price**, which fluctuates based on market forces. As the dividend per share increases or the stock price decreases, the dividend yield rises, attracting more investors and potentially driving up the stock price.

## Step-by-Step
1. A company declares a **dividend payout** of $2 per share, causing the dividend yield to increase if the stock price remains constant, resulting in a higher yield of around 4-5% if the stock price is $40.
2. The **stock price** of the company increases by 10% due to increased demand from investors seeking high dividend yields, causing the dividend yield to decrease to around 3.6% if the dividend payout remains the same.
3. The company's **payout ratio**, which is the percentage of earnings distributed as dividends, reaches 50%, limiting the company's ability to invest in growth opportunities and causing the dividend yield to become less attractive to investors seeking long-term growth.
4. Investors compare the dividend yield of the company to the **benchmark yield** of 2.5% for similar stocks in the industry, causing them to reevaluate their investment decisions and potentially sell their shares if the yield is too low.
5. The company's **dividend growth rate** of 5% per annum attracts investors seeking steady income, causing the stock price to increase by 5% and the dividend yield to decrease to around 4.3% if the dividend payout increases by the same rate.
6. The **interest rates** set by the central bank increase by 1%, causing the dividend yield to become less attractive to investors seeking fixed-income investments, resulting in a decrease in stock price of around 2-3% if the dividend payout remains the same.

## Key Components
- **Dividend per share**: the amount of money distributed to each shareholder, which directly affects the dividend yield.
- **Stock price**: the current market price of the stock, which inversely affects the dividend yield.
- **Payout ratio**: the percentage of earnings distributed as dividends, which affects the company's ability to invest in growth opportunities.
- **Benchmark yield**: the average dividend yield of similar stocks in the industry, which serves as a reference point for investors to evaluate the dividend yield of the company.

## Common Questions
What happens if the company cuts its dividend payout? The dividend yield will decrease, potentially causing investors to sell their shares and driving down the stock price, as seen in the case of **General Electric** when it cut its dividend payout in 2017. 
What is the impact of interest rates on dividend yield? An increase in interest rates will make fixed-income investments more attractive, causing the dividend yield to become less attractive to investors, as seen in the case of **Coca-Cola** when interest rates rose in 2018. 
How does dividend growth rate affect dividend yield? A high dividend growth rate will attract investors seeking steady income, causing the stock price to increase and the dividend yield to decrease, as seen in the case of **Procter & Gamble** with its dividend growth rate of 5% per annum. 
What is the relationship between dividend yield and stock price? An increase in stock price will decrease the dividend yield, while a decrease in stock price will increase the dividend yield, as seen in the case of **Johnson & Johnson** when its stock price decreased by 10% in 2020.
