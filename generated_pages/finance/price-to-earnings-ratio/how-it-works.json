  "content": "The **price to earnings ratio** is a financial metric that measures a company's stock price relative to its earnings per share, calculated by dividing the current stock price by the company's earnings per share over a specific period, such as a year. This ratio is influenced by factors such as the company's growth prospects, industry, and overall market conditions, and is used by investors to determine whether a stock is overvalued or undervalued.\n\n## The Mechanism\nThe price to earnings ratio is calculated by dividing the current stock price by the company's earnings per share, resulting in a ratio that represents how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings. For example, a company with a stock price of $100 and earnings per share of $5 would have a price to earnings ratio of 20, indicating that investors are willing to pay $20 for each dollar of earnings.\n\n## Step-by-Step\n1. The company's **earnings per share** are calculated by dividing the total earnings by the number of outstanding shares, resulting in a figure such as $5 per share.\n2. The current **stock price** is then divided by the earnings per share to calculate the price to earnings ratio, such as $100 divided by $5 per share, resulting in a ratio of 20.\n3. The price to earnings ratio is then compared to the industry average and the overall market to determine if the stock is overvalued or undervalued, with a ratio of 20 being higher than the industry average of 15.\n4. If the company's growth prospects are high, investors may be willing to pay a higher price to earnings ratio, such as 25, to reflect the expected increase in earnings, as seen in the case of **Amazon**, which has a price to earnings ratio of 30 due to its high growth prospects.\n5. The price to earnings ratio can also be influenced by the company's **dividend yield**, with a higher dividend yield resulting in a lower price to earnings ratio, as seen in the case of **Coca-Cola**, which has a dividend yield of 3% and a price to earnings ratio of 15.\n6. The price to earnings ratio can be used to estimate the company's **expected return on investment**, with a higher ratio indicating a higher expected return, such as a ratio of 25 indicating an expected return of 15% per year.\n\n## Key Components\n- **Earnings per share**: the company's total earnings divided by the number of outstanding shares, which is the base figure used to calculate the price to earnings ratio.\n- **Stock price**: the current market price of the company's stock, which is divided by the earnings per share to calculate the price to earnings ratio.\n- **Industry average**: the average price to earnings ratio of the company's industry, which is used as a benchmark to determine if the stock is overvalued or undervalued.\n- **Growth prospects**: the company's expected future growth, which can influence the price to earnings ratio, with higher growth prospects resulting in a higher ratio.\n\n## Common Questions\nWhat happens if a company's earnings per share increase? If a company's earnings per share increase, its price to earnings ratio will decrease, assuming the stock price remains constant, as seen in the case of **Microsoft**, which has seen its earnings per share increase by 10% per year over the past 5 years, resulting in a decrease in its price to earnings ratio from 25 to 20. \nWhat is the impact of a high dividend yield on the price to earnings ratio? A high dividend yield will result in a lower price to earnings ratio, as seen in the case of **Procter & Gamble**, which has a dividend yield of 4% and a price to earnings ratio of 12. \nHow does the price to earnings ratio relate to the expected return on investment? A higher price to earnings ratio indicates a higher expected return on investment, as seen in the case of **Google**, which has a price to earnings ratio of 30 and an expected return on investment of 20% per year. \nWhat happens if a company's growth prospects decrease? If a company's growth prospects decrease, its price to earnings ratio will also decrease, as investors will be less willing to pay a high price for each dollar of earnings, as seen in the case of **General Motors**, which has seen its growth prospects decrease due to increased competition, resulting in a decrease in its price to earnings ratio from 20 to 15.",
