  "content": "There are four primary categories of **Price to Earnings Ratio** (P/E ratio), a valuation metric used to assess a company's stock price, which are organized based on the type of earnings used in the calculation. \n\n## Main Categories\n- **Trailing P/E Ratio** \u2014 calculated using the company's historical earnings over the past 12 months, providing a snapshot of the company's current valuation, with **Coca-Cola** being a notable example, as its trailing P/E ratio is often used as a benchmark for the consumer goods industry.\n- **Forward P/E Ratio** \u2014 based on estimated future earnings, offering a glimpse into the company's potential growth prospects, with **Amazon** being a prime example, as its forward P/E ratio reflects investors' expectations of the company's future expansion.\n- **Shiller P/E Ratio** \u2014 also known as the **Cyclically Adjusted Price-to-Earnings Ratio** (CAPE), which uses the average earnings of the company over the past 10 years, adjusted for inflation, to provide a more nuanced view of the company's valuation, with **Johnson & Johnson** being a case in point, as its Shiller P/E ratio is often cited as an example of a stable company with a strong track record.\n- **Adjusted P/E Ratio** \u2014 which takes into account non-recurring items, such as one-time gains or losses, to provide a more accurate picture of the company's underlying earnings, with **Microsoft** being a notable example, as its adjusted P/E ratio is often used to evaluate the company's financial performance excluding non-recurring items.\n\n## Comparison Table\n| Category | Calculation Basis | Time Horizon | Example Company |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Trailing P/E Ratio | Historical earnings | Past 12 months | Coca-Cola |\n| Forward P/E Ratio | Estimated future earnings | Future 12 months | Amazon |\n| Shiller P/E Ratio | Average earnings over 10 years | Past 10 years | Johnson & Johnson |\n| Adjusted P/E Ratio | Underlying earnings excluding non-recurring items | Varies | Microsoft |\n\n## How They Relate\nThe **Trailing P/E Ratio** and **Forward P/E Ratio** are often used in conjunction to assess a company's current valuation and future growth prospects, with the **Forward P/E Ratio** being more relevant for companies with high growth expectations, such as **Tesla**. The **Shiller P/E Ratio** is commonly used to evaluate the valuation of the overall market, with a **Shiller P/E Ratio** above 25 indicating an overvalued market, according to **Robert Shiller's** framework. The **Adjusted P/E Ratio** is often used to compare companies with different accounting practices, such as **General Electric** and **3M**, to provide a more accurate comparison of their financial performance. Furthermore, the **Trailing P/E Ratio** and **Adjusted P/E Ratio** can be used together to evaluate a company's current valuation and underlying earnings, with **Procter & Gamble** being a notable example, as its trailing P/E ratio and adjusted P/E ratio are often used to assess the company's financial performance.",
