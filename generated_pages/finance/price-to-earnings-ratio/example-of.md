# Example of Price To Earnings Ratio

## Definition
Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio) refers to the ratio of a company's stock price to its earnings per share, first introduced by Benjamin Graham, a prominent economist, in the 1930s.

## How It Works
The P/E Ratio is calculated by dividing the current stock price by the earnings per share (EPS) of the company. For instance, if a company's stock price is $100 and its EPS is $5, the P/E Ratio would be 20. This means that investors are willing to pay $20 for every dollar of earnings. The P/E Ratio is a widely used metric in finance, with companies like **Coca-Cola** having a P/E Ratio of around 25, indicating that investors are willing to pay a premium for the company's shares. The ratio is influenced by factors such as the company's growth prospects, industry, and the overall state of the economy, as described by Ricardo's comparative advantage model.

The P/E Ratio can be influenced by the company's growth prospects, with high-growth companies typically having higher P/E Ratios. For example, **Amazon** has a P/E Ratio of around 80, reflecting its high growth prospects and the investors' willingness to pay a premium for its shares. In contrast, companies with low growth prospects, such as **General Electric**, have lower P/E Ratios, around 15. The P/E Ratio is also influenced by the industry, with companies in high-growth industries, such as technology, typically having higher P/E Ratios than companies in low-growth industries, such as utilities.

The P/E Ratio is also affected by the overall state of the economy, with companies in countries with high economic growth, such as **China**, having higher P/E Ratios than companies in countries with low economic growth, such as **Greece**. The ratio is also influenced by the company's dividend yield, with companies with high dividend yields, such as **Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)**, having lower P/E Ratios. According to **Gordon's dividend growth model**, the dividend yield is a key component in determining the P/E Ratio.

## Key Components
- **Earnings per Share (EPS)**: The EPS is a key component of the P/E Ratio, as it represents the company's profitability. An increase in EPS will decrease the P/E Ratio, while a decrease in EPS will increase the P/E Ratio. For example, if a company's EPS increases by 10%, its P/E Ratio will decrease by 10%, assuming the stock price remains constant.
- **Stock Price**: The stock price is another key component of the P/E Ratio, as it represents the market's expectations of the company's future performance. An increase in stock price will increase the P/E Ratio, while a decrease in stock price will decrease the P/E Ratio. For instance, if a company's stock price increases by 20%, its P/E Ratio will increase by 20%, assuming the EPS remains constant.
- **Growth Prospects**: The company's growth prospects are a key component of the P/E Ratio, as they influence the investors' willingness to pay a premium for the company's shares. High-growth companies typically have higher P/E Ratios than low-growth companies. For example, **Netflix** has a high P/E Ratio due to its high growth prospects.
- **Industry**: The industry is a key component of the P/E Ratio, as it influences the company's growth prospects and profitability. Companies in high-growth industries typically have higher P/E Ratios than companies in low-growth industries. For instance, companies in the **technology industry** have higher P/E Ratios than companies in the **utility industry**.
- **Dividend Yield**: The dividend yield is a key component of the P/E Ratio, as it influences the investors' willingness to pay a premium for the company's shares. Companies with high dividend yields typically have lower P/E Ratios than companies with low dividend yields. For example, **AT&T** has a high dividend yield and a relatively low P/E Ratio.

## Common Misconceptions
- **Myth:** A high P/E Ratio always indicates an overvalued company — **Fact:** A high P/E Ratio can also indicate a company with high growth prospects, such as **Amazon**, which has a P/E Ratio of around 80.
- **Myth:** The P/E Ratio is only influenced by the company's growth prospects — **Fact:** The P/E Ratio is influenced by a range of factors, including the company's growth prospects, industry, dividend yield, and the overall state of the economy, as described by **Ricardo's comparative advantage model**.
- **Myth:** A low P/E Ratio always indicates an undervalued company — **Fact:** A low P/E Ratio can also indicate a company with low growth prospects, such as **General Electric**, which has a P/E Ratio of around 15.
- **Myth:** The P/E Ratio is only relevant for investors — **Fact:** The P/E Ratio is also relevant for companies, as it influences their ability to raise capital and attract investors, with companies like **Boeing** using the P/E Ratio to evaluate their financial performance.

## In Practice
The P/E Ratio is widely used in practice, with companies like **Microsoft** using it to evaluate their financial performance. For example, in 2020, Microsoft had a P/E Ratio of around 35, indicating that investors were willing to pay a premium for its shares. The company's high P/E Ratio reflected its high growth prospects, with revenue increasing by 13% in 2020 (Microsoft annual report). In contrast, companies like **Ford** have lower P/E Ratios, around 10, reflecting their lower growth prospects. The P/E Ratio is also used by investors, such as **Warren Buffett**, to evaluate the valuation of companies and make investment decisions.
