# Common Misconceptions About Price To Earnings Ratio

The most common misconception about the **price to earnings ratio** is that a high ratio always indicates an overvalued stock, which is not necessarily the case, as seen in the example of Amazon's consistently high price to earnings ratio of around 80 (Yahoo Finance) despite its continued growth and market dominance.

## Misconceptions
- **Myth:** A high **price to earnings ratio** always indicates an overvalued stock.
- **Fact:** Companies like Amazon have maintained high price to earnings ratios of around 80 (Yahoo Finance) while continuing to grow and dominate their markets, disproving this notion.
- **Source of confusion:** This myth persists due to oversimplification in introductory finance textbooks, such as Brealey and Myers' "Principles of Corporate Finance", which often emphasize the importance of low price to earnings ratios without considering exceptions.
- **Myth:** The **price to earnings ratio** is the only metric needed to evaluate a stock.
- **Fact:** Other metrics, such as the **price to book ratio** and **return on equity**, are also crucial in evaluating a stock, as demonstrated by Warren Buffett's investment strategy, which considers a range of metrics (Buffett's letters to shareholders).
- **Source of confusion:** The media narrative often focuses on the price to earnings ratio as a singular measure of a stock's value, neglecting the importance of other metrics.
- **Myth:** A low **price to earnings ratio** always indicates an undervalued stock.
- **Fact:** Companies like General Motors have had low price to earnings ratios of around 5 (GM annual report) due to poor financial performance, not because they are undervalued.
- **Source of confusion:** This myth arises from a logical fallacy, where a low price to earnings ratio is assumed to always indicate undervaluation, without considering the underlying financial health of the company.
- **Myth:** The **price to earnings ratio** is only useful for comparing companies within the same industry.
- **Fact:** Cross-industry comparisons can be informative, as seen in the comparison between the price to earnings ratios of technology companies like Microsoft (around 30, Microsoft annual report) and consumer goods companies like Procter & Gamble (around 20, P&G annual report).
- **Source of confusion:** This myth may stem from an overly narrow focus on industry-specific analysis, neglecting the value of broader market comparisons.
- **Myth:** The **price to earnings ratio** is a perfect predictor of future stock performance.
- **Fact:** Historical data shows that the price to earnings ratio has limited predictive power, as demonstrated by the failure of high price to earnings ratio stocks like Pets.com to deliver long-term returns (SEC filings).
- **Source of confusion:** This myth persists due to the lack of understanding of the limitations of the price to earnings ratio, which is often oversold as a foolproof metric.
- **Myth:** The **price to earnings ratio** is only relevant for growth stocks.
- **Fact:** The price to earnings ratio is also relevant for value stocks, as seen in the analysis of value investor Benjamin Graham, who considered the price to earnings ratio in his investment decisions (Graham's "Security Analysis").
- **Source of confusion:** This myth may arise from a misconception that value investing ignores the price to earnings ratio, when in fact it is a key metric in evaluating undervalued stocks.
