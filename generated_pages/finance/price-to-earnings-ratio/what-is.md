# What Is Price To Earnings Ratio?

## Definition
Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio) is a metric used to evaluate a company's stock price in relation to its earnings per share, with the first recorded use of this ratio by Benjamin Graham and David Dodd in their 1934 book "Security Analysis".

## How It Works
The P/E Ratio is calculated by dividing the current stock price by the earnings per share, providing a snapshot of how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings. This ratio can be influenced by factors such as the company's growth prospects, industry, and the overall state of the economy. For instance, a company with high growth potential may have a higher P/E Ratio, as investors are willing to pay more for each dollar of earnings in anticipation of future growth. According to Ricardo's comparative advantage model, 1817, companies with a strong competitive advantage may also have higher P/E Ratios, as they are better positioned to generate earnings and sustain growth.

The P/E Ratio can also be affected by the company's dividend yield, with companies having a higher dividend yield tend to have lower P/E Ratios, as investors are attracted to the regular income stream. Boeing, for example, has a dividend yield of around 2.5% (Boeing annual report), which may contribute to its relatively lower P/E Ratio compared to other companies in the industry. Furthermore, the P/E Ratio can be used to compare companies within the same industry, with a higher P/E Ratio indicating that investors have higher expectations for the company's future growth and earnings.

In addition to its use in evaluating individual companies, the P/E Ratio can also be used to assess the overall valuation of the market. The S&P 500, for example, has a historical average P/E Ratio of around 15 (S&P Dow Jones Indices), with periods of high P/E Ratios often coinciding with market bubbles and periods of low P/E Ratios coinciding with market downturns. This highlights the importance of considering the P/E Ratio in the context of the broader market and economic conditions.

## Key Components
- **Earnings per share**: This is the company's net income divided by the total number of outstanding shares, with higher earnings per share generally leading to a higher P/E Ratio.
- **Stock price**: The current market price of the company's stock, with changes in the stock price affecting the P/E Ratio.
- **Growth prospects**: Companies with high growth potential tend to have higher P/E Ratios, as investors are willing to pay more for each dollar of earnings in anticipation of future growth.
- **Industry**: The P/E Ratio can vary significantly across different industries, with companies in growth industries tend to have higher P/E Ratios.
- **Dividend yield**: Companies with higher dividend yields tend to have lower P/E Ratios, as investors are attracted to the regular income stream.
- **Market conditions**: The overall state of the market and economy can influence the P/E Ratio, with periods of high P/E Ratios often coinciding with market bubbles and periods of low P/E Ratios coinciding with market downturns.

## Common Misconceptions
**Myth:** A high P/E Ratio always indicates an overvalued stock — **Fact:** A high P/E Ratio can also indicate high growth potential, as seen in companies like Amazon, which has consistently had a high P/E Ratio due to its strong growth prospects.
**Myth:** The P/E Ratio is the only factor to consider when evaluating a stock — **Fact:** Other factors, such as the company's debt-to-equity ratio and return on equity, are also important considerations, as highlighted by Warren Buffett's investment strategy.
**Myth:** A low P/E Ratio always indicates an undervalued stock — **Fact:** A low P/E Ratio can also indicate poor growth prospects or underlying financial issues, as seen in companies like General Motors, which has had a low P/E Ratio due to its struggles in the automotive market.
**Myth:** The P/E Ratio is only relevant for individual companies — **Fact:** The P/E Ratio can also be used to assess the overall valuation of the market, as seen in the historical average P/E Ratio of the S&P 500.

## In Practice
The P/E Ratio can be seen in action in the case of Microsoft, which has a current P/E Ratio of around 35 (Microsoft annual report). This is higher than the historical average P/E Ratio of the S&P 500, indicating that investors have high expectations for Microsoft's future growth and earnings. Microsoft's strong growth prospects, driven by its dominance in the software industry and its increasing presence in the cloud computing market, have contributed to its high P/E Ratio. In contrast, a company like Ford Motor Company, which has a P/E Ratio of around 10 (Ford Motor Company annual report), may be considered undervalued due to its lower growth prospects and higher debt-to-equity ratio. However, Ford's dividend yield of around 4.5% (Ford Motor Company annual report) may attract income-seeking investors, highlighting the importance of considering multiple factors when evaluating a stock.
