# Example of Price To Earnings Ratio

1. INTRODUCTION:
The price to earnings ratio, often referred to as P/E ratio, is a financial metric used to assess the value of a company. It is calculated by dividing the current stock price of the company by its earnings per share. This ratio provides insight into how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings. Understanding the P/E ratio is essential for investors to make informed decisions about buying or selling stocks.

2. EVERYDAY EXAMPLES:
Consider a small bakery that earns $100,000 in profit per year and has 1,000 shares of stock outstanding. If each share is currently priced at $50, the bakery's P/E ratio would be 5. This means investors are willing to pay $5 for every $1 of earnings. Another example could be a local restaurant with $200,000 in annual earnings and 2,000 shares of stock priced at $20 each, resulting in a P/E ratio of 10. For a retail store earning $500,000 per year with 5,000 shares priced at $30, the P/E ratio would be 6. Lastly, a software company with $1 million in earnings and 10,000 shares priced at $40 would have a P/E ratio of 4.

3. NOTABLE EXAMPLES:
Well-known companies like Coca-Cola and Johnson & Johnson have historically had high P/E ratios due to their stable earnings and strong brand recognition. For instance, if Coca-Cola has earnings per share of $2 and its stock price is $60, its P/E ratio would be 30. Similarly, if Johnson & Johnson's earnings per share are $5 and its stock price is $150, its P/E ratio would be 30. Another example is Microsoft, with earnings per share of $5 and a stock price of $200, resulting in a P/E ratio of 40.

4. EDGE CASES:
A company like Tesla, which has significant growth potential but also high research and development expenses, might have a high P/E ratio due to expected future earnings. For example, if Tesla's earnings per share are $1 and its stock price is $100, its P/E ratio would be 100. This high ratio reflects investors' expectations of significant future growth. Another edge case could be a company that is currently unprofitable but has a high stock price due to its growth potential, such as a startup in the technology sector.

5. NON-EXAMPLES:
Some metrics that are often confused with the P/E ratio but are not the same include the price to book ratio, which compares a company's stock price to its book value per share. The dividend yield, which is the ratio of annual dividend payment per share to the stock's current price, is also distinct from the P/E ratio. Additionally, the return on equity, which measures a company's profitability by comparing its net income to shareholder equity, is a different financial metric.

6. PATTERN:
All valid examples of the price to earnings ratio have in common the comparison of a company's current stock price to its earnings per share. Whether it's a small local business or a large multinational corporation, the P/E ratio provides a snapshot of how investors value a company's earnings. The key elements in every example are the stock price, the earnings per share, and the resulting ratio that indicates how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings. This consistent pattern allows for the comparison of different companies across various industries and sizes, making the P/E ratio a fundamental tool in financial analysis.
