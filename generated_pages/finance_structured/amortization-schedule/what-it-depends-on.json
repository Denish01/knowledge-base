  "content": "1. INTRODUCTION:\nAn amortization schedule is a table that outlines the periodic payments made on a loan, including the amount of interest and principal paid with each payment. Understanding what an amortization schedule depends on is crucial for borrowers to make informed decisions about their loans. The dependencies of an amortization schedule are the foundation upon which the entire repayment process is built, and without them, the schedule would be inaccurate or incomplete.\n\n2. KEY DEPENDENCIES:\n- The dependency: Loan amount\n  Why it's necessary: The loan amount is the total amount borrowed, and it serves as the basis for calculating the monthly payments. \n  What happens without it: Without the loan amount, it is impossible to determine the monthly payments, and the amortization schedule cannot be created.\n- The dependency: Interest rate\n  Why it's necessary: The interest rate determines the amount of interest paid on the loan, and it is used to calculate the monthly payments. \n  What happens without it: Without the interest rate, the monthly payments cannot be calculated, and the amortization schedule would be incomplete.\n- The dependency: Loan term\n  Why it's necessary: The loan term is the length of time the borrower has to repay the loan, and it is used to determine the number of payments. \n  What happens without it: Without the loan term, the number of payments cannot be determined, and the amortization schedule would be inaccurate.\n- The dependency: Payment frequency\n  Why it's necessary: The payment frequency determines how often payments are made, and it is used to calculate the monthly payments. \n  What happens without it: Without the payment frequency, the monthly payments cannot be calculated, and the amortization schedule would be incomplete.\n- The dependency: Compounding frequency\n  Why it's necessary: The compounding frequency determines how often interest is compounded, and it is used to calculate the interest paid on the loan. \n  What happens without it: Without the compounding frequency, the interest paid on the loan cannot be calculated accurately, and the amortization schedule would be incomplete.\n\n3. ORDER OF IMPORTANCE:\nThe most critical dependencies for an amortization schedule are the loan amount, interest rate, and loan term. These three dependencies are the foundation upon which the entire repayment process is built, and without them, the amortization schedule would be inaccurate or incomplete. The payment frequency and compounding frequency are also important, but they are secondary to the loan amount, interest rate, and loan term.\n\n4. COMMON GAPS:\nOne common gap in understanding amortization schedules is assuming that the interest rate is the only factor that affects the monthly payments. However, the loan amount, loan term, payment frequency, and compounding frequency all play a role in determining the monthly payments. Another common gap is overlooking the importance of the compounding frequency, which can significantly impact the total interest paid on the loan.\n\n5. SUMMARY:\nIn conclusion, an amortization schedule depends on several key factors, including the loan amount, interest rate, loan term, payment frequency, and compounding frequency. These dependencies are the foundation upon which the entire repayment process is built, and understanding them is crucial for borrowers to make informed decisions about their loans. By recognizing the importance of these dependencies and how they interact with each other, borrowers can create an accurate and complete amortization schedule, which is essential for managing their debt effectively.",
