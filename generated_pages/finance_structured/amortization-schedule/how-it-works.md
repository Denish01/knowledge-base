# What is How Does Amortization Schedule Work?

1. QUICK ANSWER: 
An amortization schedule is a table that shows how much of each loan payment goes towards interest and principal, allowing borrowers to see how their debt decreases over time. It works by breaking down each payment into two parts: the interest paid on the outstanding balance and the amount applied to the principal, which reduces the loan balance.

2. STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS: 
First, the lender calculates the total interest owed on the loan for the first payment period, typically a month. Then, the borrower makes a payment, which is divided into two parts: the interest owed and the remaining amount that is applied to the principal. Next, the lender subtracts the interest from the payment, leaving the remaining amount to reduce the principal. After that, the new principal balance is calculated by subtracting the amount applied to the principal from the previous balance. The lender then uses this new balance to calculate the interest for the next payment period. Finally, this process is repeated for each payment period until the loan is fully paid off.

3. KEY COMPONENTS: 
The key components involved in an amortization schedule are the loan amount, interest rate, payment amount, and payment frequency. The loan amount is the initial amount borrowed, and the interest rate is the percentage at which interest is charged on the outstanding balance. The payment amount is the total amount paid each period, and the payment frequency is how often payments are made. The interest paid and the principal paid are also crucial components, as they determine how much of each payment goes towards reducing the loan balance and how much goes towards covering the interest.

4. VISUAL ANALOGY: 
An amortization schedule can be thought of as a snowball rolling down a hill, with the snowball representing the loan balance and the hill representing the payment periods. As the snowball rolls down the hill, it gets smaller and smaller, just like the loan balance decreases with each payment. The interest paid is like the friction that slows down the snowball, but as the snowball gets smaller, the friction decreases, allowing the snowball to roll faster and faster, representing the increasing amount of each payment that goes towards the principal.

5. COMMON QUESTIONS: 
But what about loans with variable interest rates - how does that affect the amortization schedule? The answer is that the lender will recalculate the interest owed each period based on the new interest rate, which can change the amount of each payment that goes towards interest and principal. But what if the borrower makes extra payments or pays more than the scheduled amount - how does that affect the schedule? The answer is that the extra amount paid will be applied to the principal, reducing the loan balance and changing the amount of interest owed for the next payment period. But what if the borrower misses a payment or is late with a payment - how does that affect the schedule? The answer is that the lender will typically charge a late fee and add the missed payment to the next payment due, which can increase the amount of interest owed and change the amortization schedule.

6. SUMMARY: 
An amortization schedule works by dividing each loan payment into interest and principal, applying the interest to the outstanding balance and the principal to reduce the loan balance, and repeating this process until the loan is fully paid off, allowing borrowers to see how their debt decreases over time.
