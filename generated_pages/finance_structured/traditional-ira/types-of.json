  "content": "## INTRODUCTION\nTraditional Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) are a type of savings account that allows individuals to set aside money for retirement while also providing tax benefits. The classification of Traditional IRAs is important because it helps individuals understand the different characteristics and rules associated with each type, allowing them to make informed decisions about their retirement savings. The various types of Traditional IRAs cater to different needs and circumstances, such as income level, employment status, and retirement goals. Understanding these categories is essential for maximizing the benefits of a Traditional IRA and creating a comprehensive retirement plan.\n\n## MAIN CATEGORIES\nThe following are the main types of Traditional IRAs:\n1. **Deductible IRA**\n   - Brief definition: A Deductible IRA is a type of Traditional IRA that allows individuals to deduct their contributions from their taxable income, reducing their tax liability. This type of IRA is available to anyone with earned income, regardless of income level.\n   - Key characteristics: Contributions are tax-deductible, earnings grow tax-deferred, and withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.\n   - Simple example: John, a self-employed individual, contributes $5,000 to a Deductible IRA, reducing his taxable income by $5,000.\n2. **Non-Deductible IRA**\n   - Brief definition: A Non-Deductible IRA is a type of Traditional IRA that does not allow individuals to deduct their contributions from their taxable income. This type of IRA is available to individuals who do not qualify for a Deductible IRA or have exceeded the income limits.\n   - Key characteristics: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, earnings grow tax-deferred, and withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income, except for the non-deductible contributions which are tax-free.\n   - Simple example: Sarah, an individual with high income, contributes $5,000 to a Non-Deductible IRA, and the contributions are made with after-tax dollars.\n3. **Rollover IRA**\n   - Brief definition: A Rollover IRA is a type of Traditional IRA that allows individuals to transfer funds from a previous employer-sponsored retirement plan, such as a 401(k), into an IRA. This type of IRA is available to individuals who have left their job or retired.\n   - Key characteristics: Contributions are made by transferring funds from a previous retirement plan, earnings grow tax-deferred, and withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.\n   - Simple example: Michael, a retired individual, rolls over his 401(k) funds into a Rollover IRA, consolidating his retirement savings.\n4. **Inherited IRA**\n   - Brief definition: An Inherited IRA is a type of Traditional IRA that is inherited by a beneficiary after the original account owner's death. This type of IRA is available to beneficiaries of a deceased IRA owner.\n   - Key characteristics: The beneficiary must take required minimum distributions (RMDs) within a certain timeframe, earnings grow tax-deferred, and withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.\n   - Simple example: Emily, a beneficiary, inherits a Traditional IRA from her deceased parent and must take RMDs within five years.\n\n## COMPARISON TABLE\nThe following table summarizes the differences between the main categories of Traditional IRAs:\n| Type of IRA | Tax-Deductible Contributions | Earnings Growth | Withdrawal Taxation |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Deductible IRA | Yes | Tax-deferred | Ordinary income |\n| Non-Deductible IRA | No | Tax-deferred | Ordinary income (except non-deductible contributions) |\n| Rollover IRA | No | Tax-deferred | Ordinary income |\n| Inherited IRA | N/A | Tax-deferred | Ordinary income |\n\n## HOW THEY RELATE\nThe different types of Traditional IRAs are connected in that they all offer tax benefits and a way to save for retirement. However, they differ in terms of eligibility, contribution limits, and withdrawal rules. Understanding these differences is essential for choosing the right type of Traditional IRA for one's individual circumstances. For example, an individual with high income may not be eligible for a Deductible IRA, but may be eligible for a Non-Deductible IRA. On the other hand, an individual who has left their job may be able to roll over their 401(k) funds into a Rollover IRA.\n\n## SUMMARY\nThe classification system of Traditional IRAs includes Deductible IRAs, Non-Deductible IRAs, Rollover IRAs, and Inherited IRAs, each with its own unique characteristics and rules, allowing individuals to choose the type that best fits their retirement savings needs and circumstances.",
